## Overview: :memo:
This NLP project is based on the finding the sentimental score for two courier services Canada Post and Purolator according to the customer reviews using python.

## Data Understanding::ledger:
We collected our data from Canada Post and Purolator by using web scrapping technique from
online reviews. We collected data from November 2021 to current July 2023 so, two years of
data.
>By using beautiful soup library, we fetch our data from the Trustpilot website from HTML format.

#### Content::label:
* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant<br />
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test<br />
* Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<br />
* SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)<br />
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test<br />
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)<br />
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history<br />
* A ge: Age in years<br />
* Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)

## Problem Statement::bangbang:
Diabetes is a most common disease caused by a group of metabolic disorders. It is also known as Diabetic mellitus. It affects the organs of the human body. It can be controlled by predicting this disease earlier. If diabetics patient is untreated for a long time, it may lead to increase blood sugar. Now a days, Healthcare industries generating large volume of data. Machine Learning algorithms and statistics are used to predict the disease with the help of current and past data. Machine learning techniques helps the doctors to predict early stage for diabetics. Diabetics patient medical record and different types of algorithms are added in dataset for experimental analysis. we use logistic regression, random forest, decision tree classifier and gradient boosting to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. Performance and accuracy of the applied algorithms is discussed and compared.
