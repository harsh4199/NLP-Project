0,Carlos Carvalho,"Puro-late packets, always delayed, always missed, no deliver around the time they update the status.I am tired of getting packets delivered by this company, getting a message on their web site saying ""missed delivered"" when there was NO delivery attempt. I work from home, I sit facing my building entrance and there was NO Puro-late truck within hours form the moment they updated the status on their website. I don't recommend.Date of experience: July 05, 2023"
1,NA,"I just want to give negative starI am extremely dissatisfied with the services provided by this company and would rate them poorly. The behavior of their drivers is consistently rude, often leaving as soon as they hear someone approaching the door. It seems they have no interest in fulfilling their duty to deliver packages and have even suggested that I retrieve my own items from their truck. Such a lack of commitment is unacceptable for a delivery service. I strongly advise against using this company's services. It is disheartening that a significant portion, 90%, of this company is owned by Canada Post. This reflects poorly on Canada as a whole. It would be in everyone's best interest to reconsider its operations and not waste taxpayers' hard-earned money. The quality of service provided is far below what Canadians deserve.Date of experience: May 01, 2023"

3,Prachi P,"Most unreliable delivery serviceWaiting for delivery at home for entire but the delivery person did not call. Without any attempt to deliver, it was update as receiver not available.Called three times, escalated the issue but still no action and no updates at the end of the day for delivery. I have no clue when I will get my parcel. On their website they promise one day delivery. Do not charge customers if you cannot keep your promises.

5,erwin pondevida,"Bad delivery habit …Waiting for delivery but the delivery person did not call. The number was provided. The provided number was correct since they sent message after 5 pm to instead pick the item. No fail delivery slip left to inform us what to go next.

6,Chris Chebry,"SCAM TAXATION CHARGESNo matter how many times I write to Purolator regarding incorrect tax billings, they DO NOT LISTEN!!!  They charge an Alberta based company HST?!  No matter where I send my products, even within Alberta, they charge HST?!  Alberta DOES NOT HAVE HST stop charging me 13% tax on my invoices!  I have contacted Purolator three times in this regard, so their response is useless.  I have emailed and talked to a customer service rep on the phone ..... they continue to charge HST.Date of experience: May 31, 2023"

8,Maqsood Syed,"Pathetic service. Never againThe package was returned and the reason stated was “No buzz code”. They probably don’t know that something as simple as a phone call works. All the driver had to do was give a ring to ask for the buzz code, but no. They actually didn’t even attempt the delivery, because the main door was open all day that day because of some maintenance and it didn’t even need a buzz code. When I checked with the customer care agent, they updated the buzz code and said it would take 3 business days for it to be updated. Also, i was told their drivers don’t have phone. And they expected me to believe it. Just Purolator things. Never ever use their services again.Date of experience: June 28, 2023"

13,Joseph,"WORST COURIER SERVICE EVERAll my experiences with this courier service has been nothing but terrible..From fake delivery attempt to bad customer service.. They will never call or message you to notify you that they will be coming to deliver your package, then you will get a meaage to come over to their office for pickup (For God sake I paid for delivery).. One of their drivers once told me once that they don't make any delivery attempt once you get a message of failed delivery attempts.. This company shouldn't be in business..Date of experience: June 06, 2023"
14,D D,"Way to go Purolator!Ran into the Purolator driver today and he helped me out with a no signature sticker for my deliveries. That was really cool of him as he mentioned he hated leaving the stickers on my door. I appreciated what he had to say and made things positive for me today. Again I still think Purolator needs to change their policy on signatures all the time for deliveries and do not hold the driver responsible for that. Never did as I know it comes from the top. Anyway,Thanks to the driver on making my experience positive today.Date of experience: June 19, 2023"
15,Phoebe Smith,"If I could give this company 0 stars I…If I could give this company 0 stars I would it. Is the worst possible shipping company in the world? I have a fairly long driveway which I would like to say. Every other shipping company is able to navigate however purelator finds it better to leave my parcels in the dirt on the side of the road nowhere. Near my property. When I said I would like to actually receive my parcels so could they hold them at the access point? They then give me no notification of the parcel being held and if I do not pick it up within 5 days they send it back have never had. A good experience to this day my parcels are either lost stolen or left in the dirt.Date of experience: June 19, 2023"
16,Yuri Kytsenko,"Not delivered package after double delaysPaid $2 for each of 10 km of express delivery, Distance 475km, promised time- within 24 hours. Receiver all time stayed at home but after 44 hours driver has not delivered package, not left any message,  but reported absence of receiver.  There is a Purolator's outlet in delivery town but instead of leaving package there I received a note in tracking: Wed. June 21, 2023 - 2:05 p.m. CRANBROOK, BC (108 KM from RECEIVER!) Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter. According to Purolator's request for NOT delivered package people need to drive 216 km to pick up their EXPRESS package. No response to my complains Case 200912981, no apology, normal practice for Purolator.

17,Merrily MacIntosh,"WorstWorst, worst, worst courier company EVER!!! I have had nothing but problems with this ridiculous company. They take packages Willy-Nilly to places nowhere near where they say they’ve dropped it off for pick up …beyond stupid! And, absolutely impossible to get an actual human on a chat or the phone.

18,Benjamin Wright,"Absolutely horrific serviceAbsolutely horrific service, they promise to deliver on a date, they don't deliver on a date, they blame you, then tell you to be home, take the day off, its coming that day, it doesnt come that day, this process repeats, and nobody cares about the time you are wasting of your clients. Nobody calls, nobody cares, and the product still isnt delivered, at this time, I have wasted 3 full days at home on days I was told it was coming, and nobody seem to give a crap. How is Purolator still in business with this level of service.Date of experience: June 19, 2023"
19,Gordon,"ABYSMALPurolator has consistently failed to deliver on time. Complaints fall on deaf ears. Offer and charge for express service (early AM delivery) to areas that THEY DON'T DELIVER TO, only to hand off to a local carrier without daily service. Latest issue - Early AM delivery from Mississauga to Toronto. End of the day, and it's not delivered. Tracking is useless. Virtual assistant is worse. Phone call isn't answered. Requested a call back which hasn't happened. This is the last straw. I will not pay the invoice, and I've instructed my staff to use ANY courier but Purolator in the future.Date of experience: June 15, 2023"
20,V M,"Same problems every time...Awful delivery experience and same mistakes over and over. The first time I chalked it up to a bad driver and a one time occurrence but after seeing others having the same problem, and myself encountering it again, I can confirm that the drivers are incompetent and that the rules are not followed at all. Do not leave $5000 worth of computer parts outside in the rain when it's clearly marked requiring a signature for delivery! Do not leave a $2000 65"" TV on my doorstep for everyone to see when the shipping instructions CLEARLY say a SIGNATURE is required!Date of experience: June 21, 2023"
21,Andrew R-M wrath,"Disgusting practice of delaying shipments for profitsDisgusting practice of delaying shipments until they're at full load to save money at the expense of customers getting their items on time.

I did email as advised and got a response as well, which said nothing other than, that request cannot be accommodated.

25,Trakker P,"Purolator sucksI've dealt with many shipping companies in the past and so far the only one I've had issues with Is Purolator.  Last time I ordered something it took two weeks for a two day shipment because the driver would not ring the doorbell, then didn't go to the right address and then outright pretended to attempt delivery when he didn't.Called in after each problem and was met by the robot, requested a person and was forced to repeat myself a second time. After a wait, about 40 minutes, I got decent customer service.And that's the only reason I'm willing to even comment. Customer service personnel were half decent and helpful but the rest of the experience was dreadful.Never using Purolator again.Date of experience: June 15, 2023"

But they dont know if the package is there or not and there is no way they can help me, call the driver back or any form of assistance whatsoever.

30,Bill Santo,"Sneaky Mystery DeliveryI had a package delivered to my front door yesterday and did not know it was there. My office is less than 10 feet front the door and they do not ring the doorbell or knock. They just sneak it there. I was waiting for this package all day. I think they are promoting porch thieves to come over and take packages. This has happened now 4 times in a row. One time, I thought it never came and it sat overnight. If you are using this company, make sure you have a peak out the front door every half hour and hope for the best. Try Canpar, UPS or Federal Express. They can't be any worse. I will not use Purolator again.Date of experience: June 20, 2023"

33,Fiona Rinaldi,"They continue to charge 'reweigh' fees…They continue to charge 'reweigh' fees that are just totally wrong i.e. weight from 35lb to 74lbs and the dimensions to me definitely mean they either squashed the box or increase just enough to sting you more. These boxes are manufacturers boxes shipped to retail customers so they are bang on - designed to fit and the weight - well that is just a total joke. They won't review the case or refund you unless you have photos etc etc yet they can't provide you the same. This is not the first time. They come across the cheapest but get you on the other side. I don't recommend at all.Date of experience: June 13, 2023"
34,Jocelyne Ammar,"0 stars is enoughI would love to put 0 stars. We are sooooo disappointed but the service with Purolator. we use to work with Purolator and the regular delivery use to be fast. so 2 days ago, we order a delivery from Quebec to Georgetown, it's food. the Purolator stuff in Quebec new that it's food and that it contain ice to keep the food cold enough till the arriving time to Georgetown. and we bought a express transportation which it was more expensive, in order to receive the merchandise asap. within few hours, our parcel was leaving Montreal. so good. in the morning, Purolator agent tell us the delivery time is between 8 and 12 noon, super. we rush to go back home, to be present on the delivery cause it need signature. at noon, we called again and they said, oh sorry, there is a problem at the distribution center in Ontario and your parcel will arrive tomorrow or after tomorrow. we try to explain the situation. they kept repeating the same word. we try to find a solution, we ask them to call the distribution center and see if our parcel is going straight to Mississauga or not. no cooperation. i spoke to a supervisor. she looks so cooperative, BUT, she was caring more that we find a plan B for our event that was today and we ordered the food for our event. today (Thursday June 29), we check the website, it said it arrive to Mississauga, which is 5 minutes away from my home (not the delivery address), i asked to go and pick it up, the same supervisor said: we are as big as Canada post, you can not pick it up, we don't suggest to send food with Purolator so it's your mistake, only of medicine we can try to find it, but food is not our problem, you have to wait till tomorrow and you should find a plan B for you event.she was 0% cooperative, we was sooo disappointed, even she knows that this food cost us a lot and we paid for express shipping, if we went to the distribution point, and they was the same .... sorry for that, but usually professionals will be approved when obstacles appear. if they will find a helpful solution, they will be a good professional. but when they face problem and that problem will affect others and they will try to deny there responsibility, they will definitely not be a professional.  I am really sorry as much as I am disappointed, they ruin our event, we lost our money and we had a nightmare for 2 days that was concluded by cancelling our event and get in bigger lost. I wish you don’t compare yourself to Canada Post, cause they are much better, and definitely next time I will trust Canada post more then I will trust you.

36,Leah,"Terrible Customer ServiceI am leaving this review since Purolator is not user or customer friendly! I see how another consumer sees the cut and paste generic responses from the company. Shows that they really no desire to improve on customer services. I live in a rural area and quite often have issues with delivery or even getting a phone call to resolve route issues. I finally called and was put on hold and tried to file a complaint. However I was just told off by the supervisor. Fact of the matter is that even if it is the company you order your product from, the customer (me) had to pay excess dollars in shipping fees. So although I may have not initiated delivery I am still paying for the service! Go with Canada post, UPS, or even Fed Ex. At least they seem to deliver on time and have good customer service!Date of experience: June 05, 2023"

I paid 20 dollars for shipment. When I called them they said they can re-deliver it on Monday ( today is Friday) or I can pick it up from their shipping centre which is 7 KM apart.

Because apparrantly a detour of 1 block is a justifiable reason to screw up people's deliveries and schedules for days. Where do they get these lazy drivers. I already knew Purolator had the worst service of all the big delivery companies, but not even the smaller independent guys would use an excuse that lame.

If the unit was actually missing, it's easy to look up my name in the directory and dial my intercom. I was home when they supposedly attempted to deliver, so there's no good reason why they didn't deliver.I phoned to provide the unit number and after five days it still hasn't been updated. I can't even pick the package up myself at this point because I was told that the address on my ID wouldn't match the address in their system without the updated unit number.I phoned again and spoke to an agent who sounded high on drugs. I don't mean that as an insult, I mean that the way she spoke sounded either like she was sleep deprived or high on something. It was difficult to explain things to her and she kept trailing off mid-sentence and going silent.It's now been 12 days and the last update is that I won't receive my package for another 2 days, meaning it will have taken them TWO WEEKS to deliver an overnight package. Simply unacceptable.Phone wait times are 30-40 minutes long. It seems my only option is to wait.

I thought it was only the Kamloops location, but having read so many reviews, it's obviously the company culture.  The Kamloops location can take up to 4 days to move an item out for delivery once they have received it as well, causing unnecessary delays.  They can receive 5 items at the same time, and one item will trickle out each day over the next 3-4 days with the bulk being delivered on day 4, so it's simply an issue of ""We don't care!"" or ""We are incompetent!""

105,KB,"Purolator is great at being disappointingAs usual, purolator fails to even attempt residential deliveries. I've been at my current residence for over 7 years, and I don't recall a single instance of purolator delivering. This time, even with a sign indicating to deliver to the safe spot at the back of the house, an attempt was not made to follow the instructions. So after speaking with a chat agent yesterday, who indicated I should put a sign up and they'll attempt a delivery today, they picked my item up from the warehouse, and went straight to the local drop off for delivery spot 20m later with no stop at my home AGAIN. My chat experience today was the usual half baked attempt to give no timeline just vague ""A few days"" answers, and ""We're delivering a high volume so it may take some time"".Unacceptable for any non business partner deliveries. Now I'm being advised to go to the pickup location which is 3km away, with limited public transit for a 45lb item in a large box that will require me to bring my own dolly on the transit, and walk half the distance with this item on said dolly. THIS is why I paid for DELIVERY to my home.I'm sure I'll get a half baked apology that I ""feel this way"" about purolators' service yet again being abysmal because accepting responsibility for poor service and failed delivery is not purolator will take it as a 'them' problem.   I don't want a response from the company pr team, I want this service to actually be fulfilled for once in my lifetime, and that's apparently a large ask.But we all know they're laughing all the way to the bank because the business world is their staple service, screw the residential services that we pay for, right?Date of experience: June 08, 2023"
106,Vincent Ricard,"Experience with PurolatorI had been eagerly awaiting the delivery of my package and had specifically taken a day off from work to ensure I'd be available for its receipt. This was necessary as the delivery service provided no specific ETA. I made a brief trip to CoucheTard (our local Circle K) that took no more than five minutes. Upon my return, I was greeted by a note informing me that I would not receive my package until 1pm the following day. Despite the frustrating situation, I attempted to reach out to their customer support. The Purolator delivery truck was even parked right in front of me as I made the call. However, I was informed that they were unable to assist me due to their standard procedures. This isn't the first time I've had such issues with Purolator; it's actually the second. This recurring problem is precisely why I found it necessary to take a day off just to receive a package. In the future, if I see that Purolator is handling my delivery, I'll immediately cancel it. Instead, I'll opt to purchase the item from a different provider, one that can offer a more reliable delivery service.Date of experience: May 11, 2023"

THEN, the package is no longer there, all without notifications, despite having requested updates.

After the first instance of this, we requested a SNR sticker from the depot and placed it on our door to avoid any future missed deliveries but to our dismay our packages keep getting sent back to their depot. There is absolutely no way the courier attempted to deliver our packages as we have been home twice at the time of delivery. No one knocked or attempted to contact us, despite clear instructions on our order. We have contacted customer service several times and nothing has changed. I am very disappointed with the company and would not recommend them.Date of experience: April 03, 2023"

I tried reaching the costumer service after several attempts I could actually reach a person and not an virtual assistant. That was also of not Ny help.I have still not received any notification of where my parcel is. It is a laptop that I require on urgent basis! Nobody is even paying heed to it.

They do not respect the customers and their time. I would really suggest people to not use this shipping company if they want their packages. They do fake promises to the customers. I lost 2 days of my pay just because of them and still didn’t get my package and no one of them helped me to get it. They don’t even try to deliver and mark it as undelivered customer not available and it happened twice to me. I would definitely take this up and sue themDate of experience: February 17, 2023"

129,Stéphane Surprenant,"Purolator Logic: We Do Not Deliver And You Pick UpPurolator logic: we ""deliver"" packages by sending drivers that do not ring bells and do not call and, in spite of it being 2023, require you to put up a piece of paper in the window that our drivers will also not read because, to us, delivery means the client picks up their own stuff at the shop.So what did the idiot driver do this morning? Come, not ring, not call, not leave package... just spending fuel and leaving me a note asking me to do his job for him.If I had known that Purolator was going to deliver that Amazon package, I would have promptly cancelled the order.

It's impossible to be this bad by accident, which means they suck and they don't care. Why? Because they're a huge company and they aren't going anywhere, no matter how much they suck.

To reiterate, despite telling them that I can't see any updates, they're telling me to use the website to track. When I call them, they say it'll take 10 days for the item to reach Canada, and then Canada Post will take it from there and deliver it. So a 5 days ""guarantee"" is just a sham.

When we lived in Vancouver rather than leaving a package by our front door which was away from the road on a quiet street they would take it back to the Purolator store. I had to make a 16km round trip for some printer cartridges when I could’ve picked them up from Staples which was closer and had longer opening hours. Now we live in rural BC and we’re waiting for a package. We got a call to say that our home was outside of their service area so they would take it to Canada Post. I just called them to tell them which Canada Post outlet to send it to and the operator said they couldn’t do that as CP are a competitor. I told her that was not what her colleague had said in the message and she then decided she could do it after all. I’ve since learned that Purolator is 90% owned by Canada Post which makes the whole situation more unbelievable.Prior to her deciding this was OK she said I would have to drive from Pemberton BC to Lillooet which is about 60km away over a snow covered mountain pass (it’s March). I have two questions: 1) Why did they accept the shipment from the vendor if they knew that the delivery address is outside of their service area? 2) Are they hiring? as I’d love a job where I don’t have to think and nobody expects me to meet any kind of quality standards or expectations.Date of experience: March 21, 2023"

I went directly to Purolator on Monday at 1pm in Belleville to send it back to Amazon in Mississauga.  Left Belleville sorting facility at 635pm. Arrived at Toronto sorting facility at  849pm left sorting facility at 935pm....all on Monday.  It's Wednesday at 735 pm as it says it was scheduled to be delivered Wednesday.  Not delivered.  Called Purolator....apparently won't be delivered until Friday now. 😡 Seriously what the hell! This package needs to get back to Amazon so I can reorder it but can't reorder until the first one is returned.  Getting to Toronto on Monday....just needing to be delivered down the road in Mississauga takes FOUR DAYS???? That is extremely poor customer service not to mention inefficient and takes way too much time. Next time will pay Canada Post!!! It would have been delivered in a day. Purolator is pathetic!UPDATE: THEIR RESPONSE BELOW CONTACT AMAZON??   AMAZON HASNT RECEIVED IT YET SO WHY WOULD I CONTACT AMAZON???? THE PROBLEM IS PUROLATOR!!!! HOW ABOUT YOU DELIVER THE ITEM EFFICIENTLY AND TIMELY AS NOW ITS BEEN SITTING FOR 3 DAYS AND NOT GETTING DELIVERED.

170,Iryna,"TERRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICEIf I could leave zero stars, I would! Absolutely unbelievable. We ordered a TV from Sony, who happen to deal with Purolator. On the day of delivery we were both home waiting for it. When we came outside with our dog, there was a note that the delivery has been attempted but nobody was home. Nobody tried to reach out. We’ve received no phone calls, no messages, no notifications. Just the note about an attempted delivery. After this we requested re-delivery on the next day. We woke up at 8 and were constantly monitoring our driveway. No truck coming. We’ve spent 5(!) hours waiting - no notifications, no calls, nothing. Then we suddenly received a note that the TV was delivered to the self pick up location. Are you guys kidding me? What if we don’t have a car??? How are we supposed to get our TV? It was clearly stated that we ordered RE-DELIVERY! I gave my phone number about 25 times on your website and you can’t even use it? Why should I take two days off from my work to get my TV????? It’s absolutely terrible service. Why do other companies always contact us at least 15 mins earlier so that we can pick up our package? It’s nonsense. Will never ever use Purolator again. Absolutely awful.Edit: Unfortunately, I cannot reply to the Purolator’s reply, so I’ll add my comment here: what is the problem in calling your customers to inform them about delivery? Should we wait on the porch all day long? How do we get notified, if we don’t have a door bell? Why can ALL other companies inform about their arrival beforehand? Do you not care about the time of your customers at all? What is the purpose of asking for a phone number and email?

I can't speak to other areas of Ontario but where I live, I have never come across so much incompetence - which isn't a surprise considering how much incompetence there actually is in today's world - but it's the lies I can't stomach. If you order from Amazon and Purolator is to deliver it, you already know you aren't getting it on the day it says it is ""out for delivery"". I have NEVER received my package on the first day. (Don't get me started on returning with Purolator.) However, my recent order fiasco is the last straw. They say they attempted to deliver yesterday but couldn't access the front door. Let me just state that it is impossible that they couldn't do that as the front door opens onto a public square where no cars or any vehicle can park. Then this morning they say they attempted once again  - at 6:45am - but it was an incorrect address. Lies, lies and more lies to cover for the lazy and the incompetent.Because of this behaviour coupled with the fact that I am well aware of my spending power, I will be cancelling my account with Amazon. I can't take the risk my orders will be sent via Purolator and I no longer care to support a business that shouldn't be a business. Since Amazon isn't a life or death requirement I can quite easily dismiss it from my life and I will do so with pleasure. I will also be informing Amazon as to WHY I am cancelling my account.

I got a notification that it was delivered a day earlier that it was estimated, so I was pleased. However, when i went outside my apartment there was no package. I checked the app again and it said delivered at 11:26, while it was currently 4:30 and I got home at around 3:30 and the was nothing at the door. Also my partner was home during the day and no one knocked. I went to the front office to see if it was dropped off there, but it wasn’t. I checked the post area just in case, nothing there. So I contacted the delivery service in question. On live chat i was told that it was left at my front door, which it clearly was not. Then I was asked if I have checked all the common areas of the building. Sixteen floors apartment building, how do they imagine that?Then I was told that it actually was not supposed to be left at my front door and that a signature should have been taken. So they said they would start an investigation and contact me within 24 hours. A couple hours later I got an email from “ Jenn for Carene ext 71246Tracing Specialist” saying that “we have confirmed that our courier delivered this shipment to the address indicated on the shipping label and as requested by the sender, did not require a signature. We will now be closing our case, and I apologize for any inconvenience.”I replayed to the e-mail and asked why the courier did not take the picture of the delivery, as it is a standard practice; I was told previously on the live chat that the photo was unfortunately unavailable. Never got a reply. I’m sure that the parcel never made to my front door. I will be requesting security footage from building management to see if the courier ever made it to my floor with a parcel and left it without.Date of experience: February 14, 2023"

183,Wendy Rombough,"No evidence of deliveryMy order was scheduled for delivery Wed Jan 27 2023 - the day of the big snow fall.  I had checked outside about 20 minutes BEFORE the package had supposedly been delivered to our front door to see just how much snow had fallen at that time.  There was a light layer of snow, enough to leave visible foot prints.   Purolator claims the package was delivered at the time stated in the completed notice,  but can't provide proof, since the sender didn't request a signature and apparently quote, ""our drivers don't have time to take a photo"".  I sent a message to Purolator and a trace was started. It resulted in nothing but a response that the package had been delivered and the case was closed.  We were home ALL day. No one rang the door bell or knocked on the door. I am absolutely convinced that it was their designated delivery person who made off with my package and never delivered it.  Specifically because there was no physical evidence of any attempted delivery - NO foot prints in the snow leading to our front door, on the front door porch, or leading away from the door, at ANY TIME during the day.  I've had packages both large and small delivered by other companies that sat by the front door all day, with no one home until after dark - well past 10 in the evening without problems with ""porch pirates"".  ""RING"" video doorbell made an immediate sale after that experience.UPDATE:I phoned Purolator after the trace.  Where upon I was told that I would be contacted by some one in the warehouse to discuss the issue further.  (Weeks and months went by and that NEVER happened.) Purolator's action/inaction resulted in a replacement package being issued by my supplier. I stated that I only wanted it delivered by FED EX.  The Fed Ex package arrived within 48 hours, which included a photo to prove it had be placed on the front step at at 1:30 pm on Saturday.  We were leaving the house around 6 pm when I found another package on the front step. NO one rang the door bell. That package was from PUROLATOR.  How this company remains in business is beyond belief. Particularly when a trace was performed and my package was claimed to have been delivered on the day stated. YET that item magically appeared on my front porch THREE DAYS later.  I called my supplier to inform her that the Purolator package showed up some time between 1:30 pm and 6:00 pm, AFTER the Fed Ex replacement was received. She also called Purolator to express her dissatisfaction and was told, ""what's the problem, the package got delivered.""   I would have gladly returned the Purolator delivered item, but was informed by my supplier that her company had already spent enough and had written it off. Note to Purolator, don't bother contacting me.  Your words ring hollow.Date of experience: January 25, 2023"
184,Shawn Lotte,"They cannot deliver one packageThey cannot deliver one package. All they needed to do was get one box to me and have me sign for it, but that was too much to ask. The driver got confused and did not know the first number listed was the Apt number (this is how our postal service lists it) so they would not deliver it. Said it was the wrong address, said it was missing the apt number. Clearly, it was not.When I called they said it was not the apt number, but the building number: it was missing a letter—the letter B. I asked if I could pick it up. They said no. The address had to be updated first. The address... that was missing the letter B. They could not release the package or let me pick it up until the letter B was added by the sender (Rogers) to my address. I called Rogers to ask for this to be done. They said no problem, even called them while I was on the phone. But Purolator would not answer. Rogers then had to submit a request that their ""backend team"" to submit the change in address. The change was to add the letter B.Purolator would hold my package hostage, my property, until the Rogers team completed their task of telling Purpolator there was a B in my address. This would take 48 hours. It is now Monday and the package is still not ready. It is in the wrong city and it may be ready to be picked up the next day. Maybe. All this over one letter, the letter B. They had one job, and it took over 4 days to do it. Word of advice, if you see your package is being delivered by Purolator, check the address, ask that it's correct and pray it gets to you.

Call the 1800 number and said fine if they can't  deliver to a store address (lol not a Box at all) then delivery it to my freinds  house address.

Are you people that drafty?Then I decided on the 7th to go to Wainwright  Purlator at Apple Drugs. The lady was very helpful. She called Vermillion. She was told yes I am looking at it. We will have it in Wainwright  at Apple Drug's for her to pickup.  OMG I get another email it has been sent to #Lloydminster. ( It is the hub. When parcel go there they are then sent back to where they came from.)I again called Purlator  at Apple Drugs told them where it was now and that would they please get someone to delivery my parcel for me to pick up at your business.

One of the stores stopped working with purolator almost a year ago and Purolator still didn’t update their map. Just today another store where I would usually go to drop off Purolator packages told me that they don’t work with purolator annymore as well. Of course, the map of locations on the Purolator website was not updated. When I called purolator customer service to find the nearest location that is still open, the agent kept on giving me the exact addresses of convenience store that actually don’t accept purolator packages anymore! It’s impossible to find a place to drop off the packages because information on their website/or info provided by agents is incorrect, so I just end up wasting time going to those locations! And their customer service is totally useless, I was on hold forever while an agent was just trying to confirm that the location near me that accepts Purolator return packages is still open since the hours I got from agent were different from hours showing up on google maps! In fact, business hrs of the drop off locations shown on purolator website are very often different from real business hrs of those stores that after purolator drop off services. So today I waited for almost 15min on the phone while the agent was confirming hrs, and eventually I hung up as the box I was holding was heavy and I just went back home.

188,Aaron Stechesen,"Purolator is a inefficient messShipping I haven't had much issue with. Delivery of items is a whole other matter.  On two occasions I have had shipments from Alberta to Portage la Prairie. The first a storm happened here before my package left Alberta it spent a week and a half sitting in cold dry weather exactly what the item didn't need. Throughout that week and half I continued to get deliveries to and from my place of work from every other carrier. When I called to find out what the scoop was they said they were holding back packages until the backlog cleared in Winnipeg. A backlog they expected to clear by creating backlogs in other cities.So to the present. I ordered an item from a store in Edmonton and mistakenly chose Purolator as it was a bit cheaper (for a reason obviously). The package was picked up fairly promptly and was actually in Winnipeg by 5 pm the next day, which was a Friday. I thought why not try and see if I could pick it up and save them the trip. Now I wasn't expecting that would work out and it didn't but I really didn't care to much as the head office was on my route to one of my stops. I thought that I would ask if they would safe drop if I wasn't home to receive it or whether it would come back to Winnipeg. Sure enough, it was one of those deliveries that would go back to Winnipeg. I asked if I could arrange for it to be dropped at my workplace. He said, sure but you have to call customer service. What? I am standing in the office next to warehouse the package is in and YOU can't make those arrangements? So, half an hour later the arrangements are made to drop at my work address. Little did I know that because I made these arrangements on a Saturday and wasn't told that it takes a day for them to take effect that it would be TUESDAY they would deliver it to my workplace. So Monday they tried and failed to deliver it to my house and instead of doing the most efficient thing and drop it at the Purolator safe drop point they drive it back to Winnipeg. That has to be the most inefficient and cost hungry thinking (and they aren't the only company that will do such crap). So, TUESDAY they will load it back into the truck drive it back to Portage and drop it hopefully at my workplace. Again, an item that shouldn't be sitting in cold, dry weather is sitting in cold, dry weather with a company that, despite having every modern amenity, chooses to use 1990's thinking. Next time I will spend MORE NOT to have to suffer the incompetence of Purolator delivery. I will even look at other companies for my out of province deliveries (such as Canada Post. At least I know that I can trust them to take my larger deliveries to a safe drop point and not drive it backwards 90-100 kms.) No wonder it costs so much money to ship with larger carriers it isn't the costs rising from a direct point A to B delivery it's the dimwitted practice of driving packages back forth between A and B instead of using their authorized drop points fully for what they set them up for. Even a math idiot could add up the dollars floating out the tailpipes of Purolator trucks.I don't need a response to this Purolator. No amounts of apology excuses such incompetence. Clean up your company ... or, you know what, don't. I don't really care any more as I have no plans on using you again.EDIT: It is now day two after the requested redirect. They attempted to deliver to my home again. Will not safe drop with the local Purolator agent. Package is going back to Winnipeg again. Spent yet more time talking with a “customer service” rep and he had to call the depot in Winnipeg to find out why the redirect wasn’t done. The Winnipeg depot gave him the option of redirect tomorrow (yeah right) or pick up in Winnipeg at a later date as they are backlogged (gee I wonder how that happened). I told the rep they can redirect tomorrow but that I consider the package stolen and I will be reporting it as stolen to the shipper. Maybe they can apply some pressure or initiate an insurance claim. I know that as the receiver I can’t do much other than angrily discuss my options with the poor customer service reps who don’t have much power themselves. I’m so done with Purolator. I will stick with FedEx and mostly Canada Post as I have never had big issues with their service.Date of experience: March 06, 2023"

I have everything shipped to my work because it's safer then leaving things in my mail box. So they send it and don't put the business name on the package. I double checked with the shipper and they said they did. So I tried to get into contact with Purolator where they said that the only changes they can make is adding a buzzer code they can't add a business name. They literally said they could contact the driver but they wouldn't be able to do it they can only add a buzzer code. Soo they wouldn't deliver it. I asked if I could go pick it up at the depot but because I have it going to my place of work not my home my ID wouldn't be good enough. I had to wait for the package to be returned to sender for them to ship it out again. Which they did and they verified again that it has the business name on the package. Get my tracking number. No business name. So I contact Purolator again. They will not add the business address to the package. I had to have the shipping company contact them and they finally add the business name and contact the driver. Hours later my tracking number changes from in transit on the truck to delayed due to sorting. How can there be a sorting issue while on the truck? I've never had so much issue getting a package and now I still won't have a phone for 2 more days cuz it's the weekend. I will go out of my way to never use Purolator again. Even at work we ship out hundreds of packages a month and we use an app that lets us choose the best cheapest option. Even if Purolator is the best option I will pay more to never give a dime to this company. Worst customer service experience I've ever had.Date of experience: January 13, 2023"

Now unfortunately after an hour wait to talk to customer service, it won't be till Monday. Previously had purolator deliver to a business here also, which they also did not do. Had to pick up the package 40 minutes away instead.

209,Simon Domingue,"NEVER USE PUROLATOR FOR YOUR DELIVERYI was promised a 24h delivery by Amazon but I had the badluck that they chose Purolator for giving me my product. They were unable to deliver my package, so they just decided to keep it for 5 days without reason. I had to call several times to receive my order because they were unable to deliver packages correctly to my address. On several occasions, they have confirmed delivery dates to me that they have not respected. I had given, several times again, clear indications that the package had to be delivered to my address EVEN IF I WAS NOT THERE, like every other normal Amazon delivery, and they kept leaving WITH my package. Now I need to take a bus to get my box tomorrow. A delivery who was supposed to take 24h, took in fact 5 days. I would have thought that this was just a bad luck but, literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I get a package delivered by Purolator, they manage to mess it up and I have to call your their consumer service that keep me waiting for an hour.Date of experience: January 11, 2023"

Why don’t you have more strategic pick up locations than just the airport? I will now refuse to go to the airport to pick up my packages. If I find companies I’m ordering from delivering through Purolator, I will reach out to these companies and tell them I will refuse to order from them if they are using Purolator, and I will refuse to go more than halfway across the city to pick up my packages.Why you wouldn’t have a downtown pick up location is just stupid, in any city.Date of experience: January 11, 2023"

Second, no one knocked when they dropped it off and left it flat in the middle of my porch. Didn’t even attempted to prop it against the door or hide it in the MANY places my porch provides, including a screen door room that is not locked whatsoever ever. This was a small Amazon package in one of there little paper mailers, I didn’t think it would be hard to either place it nicely or hide it better.

The driver didn't even leave their contact number to call back or neither call the recipients when they arrive at the premise. I live in the basement and no effort is made to ensure the package is delivered. My house owner was also in the house when the delivery guys came and heard nothing. I had to call customer service and wait 1 hour before I can be attended to. When I ask for re-delivery, the answer I got was subject to availability. MY FOOT!

I look out my window I’m 10 minutes away from the Richmond place. And it’s very very sunny here.  I phone, was told it’s the weather in Toronto.  But I’m in Vancouver and the package is in sunny Richmond.  Yes they say but it’s snowing in Toronto.  A two days later  I get the email my package is out for delivery, at 5 pm I get an update it’s delayed due to weather.  I guess it starting snowing in Toronto.   Deliver date is not provided and who knows when I’ll get my package. And if I’m not home when they decide to deliver after all their lies they will take the parcel to Burnaby 1/2 hour away from my place.  And as they did before and yes try and have it redelivered is impossible.  Purolator’s slogan “it’s a promise” liars.   Back to package to the first package.  I should be happy that the driver phoned me even though my buzzer number and delivery instructions were on the package,   When he didn’t show up at my door I went to see where he was.  Despite the instructions to come to the apartment, he said he left in our mail room.  Our mail room?   Our unsafe walk way where the mail boxes our.  Lazy, Lairs, Lunatics.

They told me that they delivered my package, but they do not have the proof of delivery (any photo) and now they are telling me that they are going to close my complaint because they have registered the item as delivered.

We went there in the dark and the snow only to find that the package would not be available there for several days.  The fault lies with the original Purolator Note.  Very Frustrating non-service!

As soon as it became apparent that they were using Purolator to ship it I knew that I was in for trouble. I included on the delivery instructions the intercom code to call upon arrival so I could let them in. I also signed up for SMS alerts to be told of their arrival. However the only 2 alerts I received today were: your package is out for delivery, then 2 hours later: Purolator was unable to deliver your package today. What a big surprise. No effort at all to try and deliver the package. I doubt very much whether they were even there. I sat by my phone waiting for the intercom call but nothing. Not a peep. Other delivery companies seem quite capable of calling it, but not Purolator. They also did not try to call my phone number either. I’m pretty sure now that they are saving costs and trying to get people to pickup the packages from their pickup locations. Or maybe the driver just didn’t want to get cold leaving his truck to venture forth to people’s houses. Either way, the service is an absolute joke and the sooner businesses stop using these lazy clowns for deliveries the better. Up your game Purolator or just give up and go flip burgers instead.

280,Rob Ewasiuk,"One star is being generousOne star is being generous.  Like the previous reviewer I have had a package delayed a number of days tagged with ""Weather delay"".  Problem with the the company response to the previous review of there being a backlog, is the package was ""On vehicle for delivery"" but was never delivered.  Recycling packages through the system is not helping the backlog, nor customer service.  Now I have to wait another two days for attempted delivery, when the item was on the truck yesterday.  What's even more frustrating is the package contains a computer that is bouncing around in the back of a truck all day and will be again until it finally gets delivered.This company has a very serious management problem, with so many negative reviews.  It would be extremely wise for management to wake up, study  and actually address the problems being shared, rather than having frontline employees keep apologizing for poor performance, especially when these employees don't have the authority to fix anything and keep taking the heat from disgruntled customers.  Case in point, please don't apologize for this review and instead spend your valuable time providing this productive feedback to management, so the performance improves and in turn so do the ratings.By the way, it is extremely insulting to read the the same apologies for the same problems over and over.   I strongly suggest this company go to work and figure out how to change the processes and results for the positive.  Hopefully this doesn't fall on deaf ears.Update:Appears to be an automated response. Good luck improving your performance and ratings based on customer feedback.

Agent communication can provide no more information than automated system, also perceived as pacification tool.Honest, transparent information whether good or bad will go a long way in working with you and understanding issues that may arise. Blanket excuses just aggravate the situation. Tracing specialist requesting pictures, value, description, serial number of item to aid in locating item does not instill confidence, one would assume your own shipping label would suffice. Employees of Purolator must be very frustrated or experience high anxiety. Does Purolator solicit ideas from their front line workers on how to improve certain processes?

I’ve placed several complaints with customer service about this lousy service & nothing has changed. I complained about this exact same situation only 3 weeks ago & had the same zero delivery attempt from Purolator again today.

307,Nick,"Zero Packages Successfully DeliveredI've never had a package delivered by Purolator -- I always have to go pick it up at some inconvenient location. This time, they 'tried to deliver' and sent it a 2.5 hour round-trip (I don't have a car) transit adventure away to sit there for five days. Nobody left a note, emailed me, msg'd me, or contacted me in any way. The only reason I knew it was there was because I checked the original email from Dell and drilled down three levels of tracking. At first I couldn't believe it was real, as it's so incredibly stupid -- then I remembered it was Purolator. Utterly useless company.

310,paul daggett,"Purolator Business to home a complete fail..Do you know that feeling of being so…Do you know that feeling of being so uterly frustrated and upset as a consumer? You almost cant even put into words the dismay you feel about a company and how it continues to exist as a business? Purolator is the company that is at the top of my list. I concur with ALL the concerns and complaints written here. And then the generic responses in these posts from Purolator to apologize and to provide tracking # is an arrogant shameful spin on it. In my countless cases after moving to my new residence two years ago, when Purolator is the carrier provided after ordering something , they will text me that my item is ready to pickup and will be held for five days. I am 50 yes 50 kilometers from the hub to go pick it up(100 k there and back) I am not in the sticks, they just tell you your postal code is not in our delivery service area?? All other companies along with Canada Post deliver to my home or in CP case a lockbox on my street. Every company except Purolator. They should not then accept item from the business(i.e. Sportchek, amazon or any company) if they can not fullfill contract. Its wrong!? These businesses assume that the customer is receiving their item but they are not..and Purolator still gets paid as if they have delivered it?! At least third party it to a company that can get it done if its not in your delivery area. To send out a text to say gleefully that your parcel is ready for pickup is nothing short of an insult. A consumer is paying for home delivery and the business is thinking that Purolator is honouring it. Its shamefull and should not be tolerated. Business to business they are great I am sure but business to home..complete fail and bust. I actually have been successful in having them dropped as a carrier with Amazon. It was a bit of work with Amazon managers over the phone but you can do it. I have had many calls with Purolator reps along with the employees at hubs after you stand in line to pickup your undelivered item. They all have heard it before and I actually receive empathetic responses. I feel for these employeees that are on the front line receiving the frustration and the complaints, and having to endure  stories of long drives on snowy roads to come fetch an item that should be delivered? I become my own courier! And does a manager ever phone back to discuss your concerns..how about never. Honestly someone in upper management with this company or their parent company Canada Post need to take these complaints seriously . The complete lack of any understanding at the magnitude of customers frustratation should not be ignored. These real problems and delivery failures need to be addressed and corrected by Purolator. Best case is to just stop providing home(or lack of) delivery. Move over and let other capable companies provide the customer service and delivery on the so many deliveries you seem to neglect or not honour for one reason or another. Listen and act! Thanks..""Followup""    Thanks for the response Vanessa from Purolator relations but I have to disagree with you. I have been told by these businesses that when they apply my postal code the list of carriers presents itself to the shipping warehouse. Purolator comes up as a deliverable address so the shipper can choose Purolator from the list of carriers and then print a waybill for pickup. Thats wrong! Purolator has no right or reason to accept a postal code address it has no intention to deliver to. It should default out so shipper can choose another carrier. Surely your system does not accept every postal code in Canada as deliverable when thats not the case?? That really would be deceitful I think. To add even more frustration to the client when they find out their package is undeliverable, the Purolator hub and pickup points are only opened weekdays until five..closed weekends!? Thats just insult to injury when people are at school, work and maybe can not get into these pickup locations until later in the day or until a Saturday. And how about inclement weather or severe road conditions? Some may not drive or be a long distance away from these hubs. That is why a courier company is in the business is it not? To  get deliveries to people who need it. Can you imagine Purolator telling a business or corporation that they have to drive to a hub to pick up their items? Thats funny right..not really! It wouldnt happen. Stick to business to business deliveries and get out of home deliveries you can not seem to consistently fullfill. Then possibly Purolator relations would not have to defend this avalanche of one star reviews and customer complaints. Which in a nutshell is shameful of even trying to defend in the firstplace. Thanks Vanessa.Date of experience: December 01, 2022"

Purolator will traumatized you. Dealing with Purolator is a health hazard. Whether you live in an apartment building or a detached house, Purolator doesn't ring bells, they don't knock, they wont call you, they wont text you, they wont buzz you, they WILL stick a note to your door and driveway even when you are right there in your home. From what I have read here, and going by my own experience today 1/12/2022, Purolator drivers ARE NOT interested in actually delivering your package. You could be right there at your front door and they will walk past you and stick a paper on your door claiming that you were not home. These people have ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY!. It seems that the longer items stay in Purolator warehouses, the more Purolator gets paid, that seems to be the motivation behind their zero commitment to actually delivering packages to customers. Or do their drivers get paid based on how many packages they do not deliver? Any merchant that partners with Purolater is hurting its customer base. I spent about an hour today on the phone with a Purolator agent who said to me ""our drivers are not phone operators..."" (sic) as she justified why the driver stock a paper to the front door of my building (while I was home) and drove away instead of alerting me. The lady claimed Purolator drivers do not have company phones. Purolator has a serious problem of non-commitment to customers. PUROLATOR SUCKS OUT THE JOY FROM YOUR BUYING EXPERIENCE and leave you with painful memories.Purolator is paid to communicate with the house not with clients and so they stick papers on walls and doors and drive away.

351,Eugene Boucher,"WORST company in CanadaThis is the WORST company in Canada to get something ""delivered"". In fact if you want to be sure NOT to receive your package, ask them. They are great at it. I ordered computer stuff from a Canadian company in Ontario. Was scheduled for a wednesday. I ordered the thing on a SATURDAY.  So a whole 4days for a delivery. Which is incredibly long when it should take 2 days. On wednesday the driver lied and said i wasnt available for the delivery. I work from home and was receiving all the other parts of my computer from amazon. I had to call customer service. Get my things delivered to a counter near my location. They told me my stuff would be there. Keep in mind i am handicapped and cannot move as i wish. Thats why i PAID for a delivery. I was willing to go there and pick up myself instead of getting a delivery. Next morning i receive a text to go pick my thing up. I go there. My stuff isn't there. They picked it up and brought it back to a terminal. And i now have to wait until MONDAY, because they don't deliver in the week end. I paid EXTRA to make sure i get my thing on time. No customer service. Zero problem resolution. Employee hide behing procedure. No one cares. Drivers are kids who dont want to work. Do yourself a favor. Use CANADA POST. They are reliable.

I had other deliveries from Amazon, and Purolator was surprisingly the only one that could not call/buzz me.Also, when I called yesterday, the support in Purolator told me to add my email to track the delivery but this doesn't seem to work, since I received an email at 9am today about the attempt to deliver the order, but it seems that no temptation was made today...I just want to also add that if the only option to deliver something bought from Amazon is this company, I won't buy there anymore.

401,Smith Wesson,"Driver lying about late deliveries.I live in rural Alberta and the Purolator center in Calgary is responsible for this area.On several occasions,my item was not scanned until the day it was supposed to be delivered which is frustrating to say the least.Whoever the driver is that services my village, Standard, has quite the imagination.My last three shipments were a day or more late due to ""road closures""which didn't exist and on one occasion, the drive noted that there was nobody home except that I watched his van drive down the alley behind my house without stopping.I understand that things happen and the drivers get behind schedule but,spare me the prevarication.The latest event was yesterday, package out for delivery at 07:41 and at 17:09 the tracking page indicated that the driver was unable to deliver because of a ""road closure"".

They told me "" you are dishonset because I told Mr Mustafa who works there I got a message that you got my item but he said not available. The next day after I made my call with Purolator I found it in the store already since yesterday, but he did not help me the day before and just said to me ""come tomorrow"". Then, his co-worker said this message (I got on my phone) from our store and you need to show it to him yesterday, I said I did for sure that is why I came here yesterday. I surprised with his bad attitude.  He said to me “you are dishonest"" and we went through  argument chat.

405,Frustrated,"You'll Never Get Your Purolator PackageLong story short: initial ""attempted delivery"" did not occur (no one rang my buzzer nor called me and I was home all day), called to reschedule the delivery. Did not get redelivered. Called again. They said the depot is behind and would reschedule delivery in two more days. Two days pass, no redelivery. I call again, and they basically say there's nothing they can do. They can't provide me with a number for the depot, they can't contact anyone from the depot to check in, so basically my only option is to pick up if I want my package. I don't own a car; this is a piece of furniture which is why I'm having it delivered. I've never experienced a worse delivery company than Purolator. If you've ever received your package from Purolator without having to pick it up, consider yourselves the lucky 1%. I've already reached out to ask the furniture store to stop using Purolator, and I'll keep doing this for any shopping that I do in the future.Date of experience: October 26, 2022"

416,Alana Nail,"Unacceptable serviceOn September 22,2022 my niece sent 6 Rubbermaid bins of personal and household items to Halifax Nova Scotia. She was moving there for a job. The shipment receipt from the Calgary depot indicates transit time to be 5 days. I paid for the service with my credit card over $1100.00. She asked that the delivery to take place on September 29, because she wouldn’t arrive I. Halifax until late on September 28 (which would have been her scheduled delivery date) and was told that it wouldn’t be a problem. On September 27, she sent another 5 bins and again was told that it would be 5 transit days and payment of over$850.00 was paid.Needless to say deliveries never happened when they were supposed to. My niece never got any calls about impending deliveries ( she works right around the corner from her residence so meeting the delivery wouldn’t have been a problem). In fact she would get notice that no one was home to receive deliveries. This was not the case as my neice’s partner was there the whole time. Numerous phone calls resulted in no resolutions. it took 3 different deliveries over a 3 week period to finally get the bins. Some we damaged with big holes in the bottoms of the bins! When she called the company about the deliveries she was told that if she wanted delivery on a weekend she would have to pay extra! Not only was she not requesting weekend delivery they had the nerve after paying that much money to ask for more. The experience has left us with a sour taste in our mouths. We will never recommend this company. They are totally unreliable and communication with them goes absolutely no where. I am talking specifically about the Halifax branch! The Calgary depot should never have indicated that the transit time would be 5 days in both cases. They charge a premium price for their non existing service. We should have read the many reviews before even considering the company. I have no idea how any service company can be so very unprofessional especially when their goal is supposed to be service. They really should be compensating the affected customers!Sorry, but I don’t buy the excuse that the power was out and caused a delay that massive! My niece was in constant contact with the company and was never told anything about a power outage causing a problem! What about all the calls saying there was no one at the apartment to receive delivery when there was!! Excuse after excuse for a 3 week delay in receiving her own items! I can’t believe that your company is still in business, but of course since it’s tied to Canada Post (a crown corporation) I guess that justifies it somehow! If I ran a business that way, I certainly wouldn’t last long in the SERVICE industry!Date of experience: September 25, 2022"

Apparently drivers ""do not have time or the ability"" to understand how delivering packages to a multi-unit building work with an intercom. I was told that I had to put clear instructions on the package as walking into a foyer, looking at a list of names and entering the buzzer number into the keypad is beyond their drivers ability / comprehension / time. I have never added my buzzer information to delivery instructions and for the past 10 years that I have lived at this address have had countless other successful deliveries.  I was also told that this ""was not our driver as it was contracted out"" - this is not my problem. However Purolator wants to deliver the package - either through their own drivers or contracted drivers - it all comes through under one name - so if the company isn't capable of reviewing and managing the quality of their contracted providers - that's still on them.

I was home all day and there was no knock, no phone call, no buzzer, absolutely nothing. Then I check my mailbox and see they didn't even leave a delivery notice which causes me to think that they never actually came by. I spent 20 minutes on hold trying to talk to a customer service agent, and when I finally got one, she told me it will be redelivered the next business day (Monday). I was annoyed because Friday was the only day I was home all day but relieved I would be getting the package. I guess however the agent did absolutely nothing because 5 hours later I get an email saying my package is available for pickup and I have to go to THEIR warehouse to pickup my package that was supposed to be DELIVERED to me. The package is heavy and I do not drive which is one of the reasons I had it delivered in the first place! I try to be understanding that it is not everyone in the company's fault but it seems like no one I've interacted with has actually done their job here.

We say they just drive around with trucks full of door stickers. Because they just plant the door stickers in the lobby and leave without a word. The couple of times neighbours catch them in the act and ask for a package the driver always looks miffed. It's different drivers too. They do not use the buzzer. Though they will claim it is always broken. (We know it's not broken) they don't call or attempt to knock on anyone's door. Considering this is an issue across Canada I can only imagine this must be an upper management issue. They must be rushing the drivers or not vetting them properly. This has been going on for years so not just  a one time thing and it started before the pandemic. It is frustrating because when we miss a package they send it to a facility on the other side of town and customer service will try to bully you into picking it up even if there are life circumstances that prevent doing just that. We practically have to shout at them to redeliver. We do not have a vehicle. Traveling to the facility would not only cost a lot of money but would take a lot of time and be a huge inconvenience.

445,m tond,"incompetence  liesWhen I checked the tracking number for my package, it said ""a delivery attempt was made at 11;19 today if you received a notice"" blah blah, except that the driver never left a notice and said that there was no answer, I was at home it is a apartment building with a comm system that rings your cell phone, The phone never rang. When I called customer service, the driver said I did not answer, (it's a lie) and that he could not leave a notice . funny, UPS,FEDEX and Canada post all leave notices. When I asked why, nobody could answer me. So finally, I asked to pick up my package to a pre arranged location. I hope it will be there when I come. Oh, and the virtual assistant AI is just a few cells above an amoeba, totally useless, in all, I spent 2 hours trying to track my package because of an incompetent driver who lied, and did not left a notice. I received a lot of packages from UPS, FEDEX, DHL but only 3 so far with Purolator, I think I know why now. If you can , use another service, or don't . I know I will avoid them even if it cost more. I put one star only because the lady on the phone was very helpful, but the driver is dishonest and lying, 0 star for him or her.Date of experience: September 26, 2022"
446,raco carlo,"RUDE Purolator EEAt 7pm Sept 23, 2022 I went to the Squires Beach Rd depot to collect a package I missed delivery on. This was for a phone from Fido. Its impossible to arrange a re-delivery via virtual assistant. When there I was told it was in the locker and to check my text as a message was sent out. I explained it was for a damaged phone replacement and could not retrieve msg. The Lady working the shift started yelling at me that it was her job to put all items in lockers when questioned why it was placed within. I calmly tried to explain the situation but she was totally rude and commenced yelling again with atleast 6 people in lobby. I politely asked to stop yelling and explain as her coworker attempted to explain to her my issue. This employee needs anger management training and should not be allowed to deal with public. Worst experience ever and will share my ordeal with many through social media on how rude Purolator Employee was. Be aware of the tall blonde mid 50""s woman working there. She embarrassed her coworkers as well as every other customer within lobby areaDate of experience: September 23, 2022"
447,Julie,"Worst Service EVER !Worst service EVER !I was supposed to get my package delivered yesterday so I stayed home the whole day checking my phone every 5 minutes to make sure I do not miss it.They tried to call me but the call rang once before it ended. I called back twice while my boyfriend was getting outside (we live in a building of appartements). They picked up the phone and hung up without saying anything. When I finally got to talk to someone over the phone, the woman said she had left. Plus she DID NOT leave any note on when and how to get our item. We did not received any update by email or text (which I had signed up for). I tried to reach someone on their website yesterday using the chat but it is fu**** up! It says to check the note that has been left on how to get our package but the delivery person did not leave ANY.When I request to be connected to an agent, there IS NO ONE available or it keeps ""connecting to an agent"" forever with no one picking up.When I ask for redelivery on Monday at last, it says it can only be by tuesday. BUT, I can make arrangements to be home on Monday (still I have to work so I can not spend the whole day outside in front of the building !) but not for the rest of the week.I have to go to the office and so does my boyfriend.We called customer service and waited for so long but non one answered. Thé automatic thing said they have no information about where the package is so impossible to schedule a pick up or anything else.We need this package urgently but it seems they are doing anything to prevent that from happening.We are very upset about the quality of their service which is extremely poor!Do not recommend at all!!Date of experience: September 22, 2022"

456,Scribbenik,"UPDATE: Almost at Number One for the worst customer experience I’ve ever had!I don't often write reviews, but having dealt with five bellends at this particular company I felt I had to get it off my chest. Just don't use Purolator. One of the worst customer experiences I've ever had.UPDATE Day 5: A day on (this is day 5 trying to get my package), and the customer service has actually become worse. I was today informed that my order was 'on it's way'. This is not the case. When phoning Puralator, 'Jenny' answered. Put me on hold, and then just left me on hold - until 'Brooke' answered. She told me that yet another colleague had put in the wrong address information. Utterly, utterly useless. Hopefully if you are reading this review, you will consider using a different company.UPDATE: Day 7.So far I've been told...• To pick up my package from Aero Drive.• The package is stuck in a locker - I was literally told this by the gentleman who put the item in the locker.• That the package would be sent to Eastem World Wide Inc in Calgary.• That the address was wrong.• That the address change had come through.• That the address change had not come through.• Confirmation that the address change had come through.• That the address change hadn't actually come through.• That the package was 'on it's way' again.• That there was a problem.• And now... nothing.UPDATE:Because even the company that is sending me the package think that Purolator are hopeless, they have phoned them and confirmed that the emails that Purolator deny having were definitely sent. So either Purolator have systems that don't work, or employees that don't know what they are doing (probably both).FINAL UPDATE (YOU'LL LOVE THIS):So... I've just heard from the company that sent the package - and Purolator have informed them that they have LOST the package. I thought this was the case, and have been continually lied to by numerous people at Purolator, that it was still coming.The irony is - I know where the phone is, and have been telling them this for 7 days. An employee at Aero Drive PUT IT IN A LOCKER. I spoke to him. I met him. He knows it's there (or else it was a very strange lie to tell, and make me drive to the facility to pick it up)!So - if you use Purolator, you MIGHT get your package, or you might be lied to and then still NOT get your package. Your mileage may vary. All I know is, the package is being sent, and Canada Post is being used.Date of experience: September 17, 2022"

I was in a complete fret as my daughter was back in Ottawa and needed these 2 articles of clothing by Friday. At Purolator I met 2 amazing employees June and Shelly. From their friendly greeting to their helpful suggestions on the best way to send these articles, I felt like I was in the company of friends! To say they were beyond helpful, kind and professional would certainly be an understatement. The computer was really slow , and would not accept payment. They tried several attempts and were so apologetic.  It didn’t seem like lost time because we were chatting.  This is the kind of service companies strive for, where the customers leaves feeling welcomed , valued and treated like a friend.  I would like to suggest that these two ladies get some kind of recognition. Valued employees like these two ladies should be made an example of , they deserve it and have earned it. I can only imagine how amazing life would be if every person in these positions had just a bit of their kindness and helpfulness .

They literally laughed at the line up of irate customers as they refused to help us. It was appalling. Our packages were placed in self-serve boxes outside the facility which we could not access and they would not open for us even though we had our delivery notices and ID. Nowhere on the delivery notice did it mention that we needed a special code to access these boxes. Allegedly, the box codes were texted to us so they can't open the lock boxes. This is absolutely ridiculous and an obvious lie. I've never experienced a company so happy to be so unhelpful.When I explained that I could not access my texts because the package I was picking up was a new phone, they told me to contact the phone company. They wouldn't let me use their phone or wifi to contact my phone provider even after I explained that I had no way to contact them on my own because I had no working phone.Myself and another customer demanded to see the manager who refused to come out. What I would like to know is, what will happen to the lock box my phone is in when I request reattempt delivery? They are going to have to open the lock box to send it back to me so they obviously can access the lock boxes.Fido and Rogers need to end their contracts with Purolator immediately.Their service is trash and they treat people like trash.Date of experience: September 15, 2022"

Another problem the company accepts Heavyweight shipping but you won't be getting your shipment because they need 2 agents and you need to wait days and days to have your package even if you need it.Date of experience: August 26, 2022"

The delivery guy didn't even press the doorbell i just got my notification from Amazon that i missed my package. I tried to call the customer service but no one answered for more than 10mins.

Was supposed to get my package delivered Tuesday August 16/22 but apparently my address was missing my unit number - so far no problem even though they had my cell phone number and didn’t call me until the evening.The lady left a nice message with a number to call and info req’d to complete delivery Wednesday August 17/22.  I called and left voice message with the info - so far no problem.Never showed up Wednesday and wasted my whole day.  And instead of dropping it off at the store front depot 5 minutes from my home must’ve took it back to main depot - problem starting.  So I googled puralator Edmonton North and went there not knowing this wasn’t the real Edmonton North.  Lady there was nice at first then became snarky and basically said we don’t know/can’t help phone Purolater.  I called there 1-888 number and was on hold for a while ~0.5 hr and gave up.  Came back home and tried again from my land line .....  waited again for ~0.5 hr and finally talked to a person.  I gave her the info I had already given in my voice mail.  She entered it said it was all straightened out and gave me the option of home delivery Thursday August 17/22 or they would drop it at the store front and I could pick it up there.  Waited at home most of Thursday morning August 17/22 for delivery again no show.  I checked my status and they scanned it this morning 7:03 am at the real Edmonton North at it showed - still waiting for address resolution.  Same info I left in voice mail Tuesday nite and the girl said was corrected on Wednesday afternoon - now I’m really upset.So again phoned the 1-888 number and had to wait ~20 minutes to talk to a person.  I expressed my concerns than lost it when the lady couldn’t explain why no one responded to my numerous voice mails to 780.642.4424 and why the address problem wasn’t sorted out already.  But after I let her have it said my parcel should be delivered tomorrow.My cell number was on the shipping info so all they had to do is call me or check their voice mail and this whole situation could’ve been avoided.I use Canada Post and this happened to me before.  They left my package at their nearest store outlet and called me and I drove their in 5 minutes and got my package the day I was supposed to get it.Date of experience: August 18, 2022"

509,Jude A Bruins,"Pretty DisappointingI tried using the Purolator online auto assistant to arrange for a package pickup. After every step in the process, there was a several minute wait until I typed in “Are you still there?” after which the next prompt was given. When a pick up date and time was finally given, the auto assistant started all over, asking what I wanted? I called the company and was put on hold, only to have my call dropped after a few minutes of listening to Muzak and having the suggestion to use the auto assistant tossed at me several times. When I finally got through to a human being, she sounded like she absolutely hates her job. If Purolator treats its staff the way it treats its customers, I’m not surprised that the customer representative sounded so depressed.

I asked if it would be easier to redirect to a more central location. The person sending was told that the delay was due to my asking for a redirect yesterday, which I did not, as I just asked for that this morning after being told about heavy volumes.

526,Oleksandr,"Does Purolator care about safety of deliveries?I've never had any issues with Purolator before, until the last delivery of two computer systems purchased from Dell. I saw Purolator truck by the building, so I ran outside to pick up two boxes (the building's intercom didn't work). The driver inside didn't see me, so when he approached the door of the truck he just dropped the box on the floor. I told him that there was a computer system inside that box. He said that nothing is going to happen to it, and if something is wrong that he advised me to contact them. Since I was present there, he didn't drop the second box on the floor, the way he did with the first one. I've heard before stories how some Fedex or UPS drivers drop boxes, so it was kind of expected. It's understandable that that driver didn't care that he deals with other people's property (which can also be expensive), that it clearly said Dell on the box and there was a tag with product details on it, it didn't bother him that he can damage that property....it's clear that those things didn't bother him.

They deliver it next day and send me a text. Okay great start. Then a follow up text with a link saying I can sign off for delivery. Click the link to a page that says ""package requires signature"", but no way to sign or contact driver.

I get another pickup slip, item will be held for 5 days again. Then my package ends up being delayed and connection missed between the last failed delivery and transport to locker. A day later it ends up being sent back to the airport on the other side of the city?!? So I just paid 30 bucks for them to drive my package around the city and not even being able to pick it up.

What a company!!July 20th....After a day of headaches of trying to get my delivery, it finally arrived. A nice lady at Purolator must have worked some magic, because it arrived just after noon today. Today's delivery driver was miffed about the other 2 drivers (I gather 2 drivers from the trip info I had), that couldn't figure out how to ring my buzzer or even find my building. Anyway, he had it together, so all is now good in that respect.  But, there is still the ongoing problem of communication between the seller, the buyer (me), and Purolator. There seemed to be no avenue for me or the other 2 parties to actually talk to each other to add info onto the order and straighten things out. I suggested to the nice lady at Purolator that they should maybe make some changes in protocol's for when deliveries go off the rails. In the end, Purolator did come through, but it was a rocky road to make it happen.Date of experience: July 19, 2022"

Maybe l’ll try the force next time. Anyone who has had them deliver through Amazon I urge you to call Amazon and tell them how bad of service purolator is maybe they will drop them as a client and this company can finally go out of business.

LISA has outstanding customer service, interpersonal skills and highly unusual in this day and age, she genuinely cares!! Lisa’s attention to detail and problem-solving skills were used to track a package that was misdirected to Amazon. I was shipping this package for my cousin from PICKERING to Ottawa- 1day delivery. The package never arrived. An investigation was initiated by my cousin from Ottawa, only to be closed, result being LOST!!  However that investigator and I know her name is Margaret, (do not misunderstand, that is my name as well)  Margaret, the investigator had NOT  even called  the  Squires beach location that the package was shipped from nor did Margaret speak to anyone from the Squires Beach location. Two weeks later, I decide to go to the Squires Beach location and speak to Lisa.  I had no idea they closed the investigation until this point.  We spent an hour together calling Amazon, Lisa remembered placing the package in a Purolator bag that is deemed for Amazon deliveries.  Lisa spent her time tracking phone numbers and speaking to an Amazon representative who was extremely helpful and determined to locate the package. The package was located and delivered to Ottawa the very next day.  Here’s the timeline: May 31st Shipping package to Ottawa, June 10, the investigation was canceled by investigator, MargaretJune 15 th Lisa’s investigation from Squires Beach location, package found and delivered to Ottawa June 16th package received by customer in Ottawa.  Thank you very much Lisa! Thank you for caring enough to spend time during a busy morning. Lisa’s skill set and work that ethic is not being utilized to her full potential, in my humble opinion!  Since it was my responsibility to ship this package to Ottawa for my cousins I am feeling so much better that I was also able to help them in locating the package. This would not have happened had I not gone to Squires Beach Road and spoke directly with Lisa the original contact person.

Only found out a delivery was ""attempted"" after an alert from a third party package management app (NOT Purolator's app) mentioned it. Customer service chatbot didn't function on my computer or phone for unknown reasons (disabled all my blockers and anti trackers, tried incognito, nothing) so had to use spouse's computer and then phone, still not sure if a pickup can be scheduled as the delivery ""attempt"" was apparently after opening hours. Not to mention that the tracking seems to be saying it's in a city 2 hours away, which it better not be as I do not have a vehicle!Will see if pickup can be arranged but this is not my first terrible experience with this company - a few years ago I ordered an important medical device only for the driver to buzz in and then leave before the buzzer even finished ringing (spouse saw them leave out an overlooking window) and had to run down the stairs to stop him, when he was halfway across the road by then (and not on a crosswalk, on top of everything else).

Well, I found the delivery notice in the mail room ""We're sorry we missed you"".  The driver never called us.  Our entrance phone is connected to our cell phones, both of us, one call missed on the primary phone, it goes to the secondary phone.  My wife received a text from Purolator June 3rd stating package is available now for pick up in Richmond, we live in New West.   The delivery slip says the package is available for pick up in New West, confusion or what.  This is typical of Puraltor, I don't kmow how they stay in business.John MDelphine, I appreciate the follow up, but it does not matter at this point.  In the end I had to make to stops to pick up my shipment, New Westminster and then drive to Richmond to pick up the second piece.  Not to mention the waste of fuel, but the two hours I had to give up to pick up my goods.  If you want the tracking number email the request and I will supply it.  But the matter is closed for me.JohnDate of experience: June 03, 2022"
603,ThePassionateGamer,"The worst experience I’ve ever hadThe worst experience I’ve ever had. I’m actually laughing. They sent my package to a different city! They have confirmed that’s it’s lost and there’s nothing they can do. They told me to contact the eBay seller to get a new one! They offer no compensation considering they sent it to a different city. Apparently it was “delivered to my door” what a lie! Not even the same city, nor does that city have the same street name lol. The “chat” on their site is the worst as well. Don’t even bother with that. I’ve literally had one experience with purolator and it was this. No wonder the reviews are so bad. I never leave reviews but I had to for this because it’s so bad and if of of their “quality control people” try to respond to this, save your PR. You’re garbage.Date of experience: June 03, 2022"

605,Patrick H.,"Horrible experience - Offer No ResolutionHorrible experience. I ordered a product on May 26th. The package was meant to be delivered on May 31st. At around 10:41 am, the tracker mentioned it was on a vehicle for delivery, then was later updated around 4:18 pm, with ""Attempted delivery - packaging issue"". So, no delivery driver showed up at my door, which I would've been aware of as I have two very loud dogs, and was watching for them all day.After trying to call Purolator to figure this out, I was on hold for about 30 minutes without an answer. That hold song is infuriating. Next, tried to use the online chat which was also a nightmare, as it did not work with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, and finally worked with Firefox. To talk to a person, you have to explicitly tell the bot that you'd like to speak to a person multiple times.Finally, once I was connected to a real person, after giving them some sensitive information, they told me that the package wasn't able to be delivered due to damage. They mentioned that this would be sorted out by Purolator soon and would update the tracker.That same night, at around 6:55 pm, the tracker was updated with ""Resolution required - shipment refused"". Then, the following morning the tracker was updated at 6:48 am with the same message.After speaking with the online chat again, I was told that I personally had declined the package because I deemed the package damaged. How could I have possibly denied the package if I never saw the package because it was never attempted to be delivered to my home?What's going on here Purolator? Did your driver assume that no one was home because there weren't any vehicles in the driveway and skip delivering to my home, and then give some bogus excuse as to why it wasn't delivered? I was also denied the ability to go in and pick up my package in person. The online chat said there was no possible way for me to pick it up in person. They also told me that I'd have to reach out to my seller, to get them to issue a replacement.Why is it that your driver did not attempt to deliver, then lied about me saying the package was damaged? Why was I denied access to view my package, and see if it is damaged or not? If the box is damaged, I could care less! Now I have to go through my seller and go through this entire waiting process again. The seller also told me to pick up the replacement in person at Purolator, but the problem is Purolator already said this wasn't possible.Do better Purolator. It's actually sad how horrible this experience has been. My packages from across the world, in China, which was ordered after my package with Purolator, made it to my home before Purolator could deliver a package that is 30 minutes away from my home.I'd honestly give -5 stars if I could.Date of experience: June 01, 2022"

I'm still disappointed but admit I am satisfied with at least knowing what's going on.

The first time there was no reason provided or an update for expected delivery date until just before the package was delivered. The package contained Mother’s Day Gifts and since they were 4-5 days late they didn’t arrive for Mother’s Day which left my children disappointed when they didn’t have gifts to give their grandma and Mom.I am still waiting for my second package that was supposed to arrive on May 27th and then updated to May 30th (today). The package contained bathing suits my daughter really wanted for our Great Wolf Lodge trip. I went on last night to see if they had been delivered to the warehouse so I could pick them up knowing we were leaving at 11am. There was still no update but yet they were supposed to be delivered today. I went on again this morning, still no update. My daughter is extremely disappointed she won’t have the new bathing suits she picked for our trip.

619,Suzanne Scaini,"Very Angry and Disappointed!!I am extremely disappointment and angry at the service received from Purolator.  Your whole “It’s not just a package it’s a promise” is a joke.  I went to the Purolator office in London, Ontario on May 19, 2022 to send a package to my mother who was in Burlington visiting my sister.  It contained her medications.  I asked the representative if it was okay to do that and she indicated yes as long as it’s in Canada.  It was suggested that I sen it to the depot in Burlington where my sister could pick it up between the hours of 8 to 8 because of her job she would not be at home when package might arrive said great let’s do that.  I paid left the store thinking everything was okay.  I checked my email the next day while driving to Ottawa only to see the update stating that the Purolator driver missed the connection and now the package wouldn’t be available for pick up until the 24th.  Not acceptable as package needed to get to my mother urgently.  I called customer service and was left on hold for 30 minutes until a Representative named Shelley answered.  May I just say not a pleasant person from the get go.  I explained situation she said package was sitting on a truck somewhere didn’t know exactly where.  She also said it was showing that it was going to be sent to a Purolator outlet at some variety store and because it was a long weekend they wouldn’t be open till the 24th which was Tuesday.  I explained to her that It was supposed to have been taken to the depot and that there hours were 8 to 8.  I did this because it was going to be easier for my sister who was picking it up. I also explained the seriousness of the situation as my mother needed her medication or she very well would end up in the emergency department without it.  She typed up the message and sent it wherever. It did no good as I received an email shortly after stating that due to unforeseen situation the package wouldn’t be available until the 24th.  Unbelievable!!!I contacted my sister who then had to contact the pharmacist and plead with him to redo medication.  Let’s just say he was less than impressed quite annoyed.  We than had to ask a elderly family friend to pick up meds before they closed and drive them to Branford where my sister met her halfway. My mom ended up giving her $40 for gas. So on top of the charge to Purolator it cost her $$ not to mention the gas, time and stress  this caused all of us.  Will not use your company again and will not recommend it to anyone either.

Toronto to Hamilton Purolator Express shipped Friday and its now Wednesday and the parcel is still stuck in Toronto sorting center. Customers choose courier as a quicker yet more expensive option and when it turns out to be the much slower option at a higher price, we get the complaints from customers and have to refund their shipping or the difference. The causes headaches for our staff and leaves a sour taste in our customers mouth. As I see there are hundreds of terrible reviews dating back some time and it seems to be the same complaints without remedy.

They tell me that it is not in the depot and the guy that handles the large packages won't be back till Monday, Tomorrow being a holiday.Go home and wait for a call is what they tell me.  Now my question is why did it go out on a truck anyways as they said it was not back yet.  And why did they not call up and I would have brought it in myself.  They are unable to figure out something that simple.  I am going back Saturday even if there is no call.  I was forced to use pirolator in the past and always had problems.

From 50 feet away I tryd yelling thru a megaphone on my balcony to get his attention. As the driver was backing out of the driveway he looked right at me and drove down the street like he did not care. In my opinion do not waste your time shipping thru Purolator. The company doesn't allow their drivers to have a cellphone to contact clients/customers. They also do not allow them to accept any tips. Which means that there is zero incentive for any Purolator delivery personnel to get the customers delivery made. When speaking to their customer service about the issue they had a similar approach. Pass the buck attitude, they wanted to put me thru to a manager on the other side of the country.

I'm currently self isolating with covid and sent my friend to pick up my parcel at said home hardware today (April 1st) and there was no parcel. I called purolator in which they said my parcel would arrive at the home hardware later today. To my surprise it was sent back to my home address, no one is home again (duh) instead of taking it to the damn homehardware that it was supposed to be delivered to 3 days ago!! An hour after getting the update (once I seen the update) I called purolator again to tell them to turn around and to drop the package off at my house or homehardware, just leave it and stop carrying it around. I was told there was nothing they could do (even though it was only 3pm) and that if have to wait until Monday the 4th, 6 days after it had initially arrived! Just can't believe I have to go through this to get my parcel. Utterly ridiculous and embarrassing for purolator, look at all the bad reviews.

I wasn't able to pick it up all week as I've been extremely busy, but I left notes with the customer service rep to redeliver the package, but instead it gets sent back to the sender.This is not just a one off experience, but literally EVERYTIME I have a package delivered with Purolator this same thing happens. And the customer service reps have no idea how to fix it, I have left notes every time to guide them step by step how to contact me when the courier arrives, but still nothing changes at the delivery level. Just such a terrible company, if only I could get negative starsDate of experience: March 22, 2022"

713,Lily Boutet,"Tossing packages or not delivering to addressI have sworn off Purolator and asked Amazon not to use them because they refused to not walk down a small hill that my 80 year old neighbour walked the day before. Instead Purolator would bring my packages to Banff where I would have to drive 28 km, pay for a national park pass and parking in Banff to pick up. My husband had not requested the same delivery service from Amazon and had his package delivered yesterday by Purolator where it was thrown about 20 feet and the box was crushed. My husband has since called Amazon and asked them to also switch his delivery to Intelcom. After hearing what happened, Amazon insisted on giving us the item free. Intelcom thankfully not only delivers to the door, they leave a text saying when to expect it the day before, and supply a picture of the package on your porch and the address on the house on delivery.

House number where it was left on a porch that isn't used by the house owner, was completely wrong and the package was on top of a bunch of junk to the left of the door obscured by a hedge which is why it took me so long to find it after scouring the neighboring streets and houses.  Found it after filing a not received complaint with Purolator.  Was told an investigator would get back to me at which time I intended to file a complaint citing delivery driver ineptness.

748,sl,"Long wait in sorting facility - no updateUsually Purolator has been quick with my deliveries, I would say 2-3 days, which is why I'm questioning what has happened to the recent status of my package. I made an order from the same sender January 30th, expecting it to arrive that very week. Checking on the status, it was picked up January 31st and has been sitting idle in the Toronto sorting facility to expire and today is February 14th (and indefinitely). I contacted the sender February 10th about the delivery delay and they proceeded to contact Purloator. I was told by the sender an investigation has been issued and to wait 5-10 business days? Sorry, let me get this straight why does it take that long to find out where the package is unless its ""lost""? It got scanned then where did the package go after? I highly doubt an investigation is being conducted because I am not getting any updates. This unreasonable time frame is being added to the time I'm patiently waiting on already. Purolator is asking too much from their consumer. I've had to make an order with another company who sent the package through Canada Post, I made the order on February 10th and its already delivered today. Another order made yesterday and will be delivered by Envoi today. There's no excuse about weather or being overwhelmed since its not the holidays.I did contact Purolator myself online, but again, its the same response concerning the investigation. Not the agent's fault since she isn't in sorting department, but whoever is, needs to be taken accountable for this. What would happen if I never checked the status of my delivery and or assumed this was a standard wait time? Purolator would never be responsible to contact me to admit to this mishap. I rather they be honest with their mishandling instead of me waiting for unreasonable length of time so that this can be fixed sooner. How much more time do I have to wait, another couple of weeks (imagine a month to deliver within a province, out of country is quicker than this service) and nothing comes out from the investigation? I hate the thought, waiting this long for them to just tell me its lost or magically disappeared into thin air because that is the easiest excuse and say sorry? Seriously, if this happened to yourself you would be angry and question why the package is still sitting in sorting? I've already lost trust in Purolator. The bad thing now is if the package is conveniently ""lost""or ""something else"" and the sender sends a new shipment, it will be with Purolator unfortunately and the potential for this endless loop where I have to wait for many more months in the sorting facility is definite. Reading the reviews, someone's package recently went lost in the Toronto facility too. What is there a black hole?What now? Is it thank you for wasting my time, my money, and causing inconvenience? There's no point for Purloator to apologize after seeing all the negative reviews, no one is addressing the internal issues with Purloator and allowing this to go on and on. What's the point on getting feedback from the consumer when nothing happens, they take your money and not deliver what a great business model. If Purolator truly and wants to genuinely help me, go out of your way, then have my package delivered by this week the latest or let me know its lost already so that I can get a new shipment from the sender.

Its so inconveniencing to have purolator deliver your item. They never make any attempt to deliver. My item (RDT000110312) was supposed to arrive on 4th February, I'm still waiting for it. They falsely updated that they have this in their vehicle for delivery today. But, when we called, we were told that it will be loaded for delivery. So unreliable! This has been my experience each time I have had to wait on them for delivery. In spite of the numerous bad reviews about the company, nothing is changing.

756,Amanda Martineau,"Atrocious experience. Lazy drivers, excuses from support, still no packageAs others have said, if I could give them 0 stars, I would. Absolutely horrendous experiences.After not receiving an update on the status of my items for over a week (I also got hit by the ol’ “Natural Disaster” B.S excuse, when there have been none in Canada as of late), I attempted to use their self-service “Virtual Assistant” to see if I could figure out what was going on. What a joke! The chat webpage kept refreshing and kicking me out of the chat, meaning I had to go through the process of entering all my contact information 5+ times before actually being able to speak with anyone. I eventually gave up and called and sat on hold for 15 minutes so I could actually speak to a real human and not get booted out. (By the way, the only natural disaster I see happening here is your employee’s consistent and complete incompetence.)After many apologies and excuses on the phone call, the customer support person reassured me that my items were indeed in transit and that the best way to know when they would arrive is to turn on the email notifications and wait for the “out for delivery” notification. Ha, ha, hahahahaha. Please keep that recommendation in mind as we move forward with this tale. So I wait. And I wait. And I wait some more. FINALLY yesterday I see it’s in my city and shortly after, I receive my “out for delivery” notification. YAY, this is what we’ve been wait for, right?!?! Right…. Hah. An hour later, I see the status has been mysteriously changed back to “delayed in transit”. Huh? How the heck is it delayed in transit?! It was on a truck out for delivery in the city I live in just before that? So I hop back on the Merry-go-round with customer support yet again. All the person on the phone can offer is “yeah it looks like they’re really busy in your area.”. Soooo it was out for delivery and then the delivery person decided at noon “nahhh… Ima be too busy today. It’s lunchtime. The rest of these packages can wait until tomorrow… I’m “too busy””?????!?! The customer support person asks me to wait one more day and that it will be delivered tomorrow instead. They tell me to watch for that sweet “out for delivery” notification email yet again. “This will let you know the driver is on the way…” they assure me again. And so I wait… Today at 9:30am I hear that ever anticipated “ding” from my email and see my item is out for delivery again. YAY! This has got to be it, they can’t mess this up again… 20 minutes later, my package is now ON ITS WAY TO A SHIPPING CENTER. What the actual eff?!?!?! I got outside. No delivery attempt notification, nothing.I call support AGAIN (this is the third time this week in case you haven’t kept up). “Oh yes, that’s very strange, I can see it went out and no delivery attempt was made but now it’s being redirected to the shipping center. I don’t know why. Someone must have made a mistake”.I ask for an explanation why. They cannot offer me one. I asked to speak with a manager and they transfer me. The manager starts the conversation by asking “what can I do to fix this for you?” and I respond by saying they can find a way to have the package delivered to my front door today. They told me they would make some calls and get this fixed. I just received a text saying the item is at the shipping center and I have 5 days to pick it up. I don’t have a car, I don’t drive, and I work until 4:30pm every night. There is literally no way for me to go get it within their hours, so it’s likely going to go back to sender. You guys are literally a shipping/delivery company. We pay shipping on items to have then delivered to our doors, not to have you give us hope it’s going to be delivered more than once only to have it rerouted to your shipping center with absolutely 0 explanation as to why. Like… I cannot count the ways you’ve messed this up. This is literally your business. Stop making excuses, own your issues, and do better. I’m with the other commenters - I will boycott companies using your services because that’s how badly you’ve screwed this up.Date of experience: February 04, 2022"
757,Sharon B.,"Purolator has not fulfilled its promise…Purolator did not fulfill its promise to deliver a package and obtain a signature.  Here is the sequence of events.1.	Package was picked up by Purolator on Feb. 2 destined for Calgary, AB.2.	Package arrived at Calgary sort facility at 7:40am Mountain time on Feb. 3.3.	Package was on vehicle for delivery at 8:19am on Feb. 3.4.	Delivery was attempted at 4:12pm —according to tracking info, receiver was unavailable.  (not true, receiver was there all day and available to sign for the package)5.	I, as the shipper, called customer service to arrange redelivery.  Arrangements were made to have the driver deliver on Feb. 3.  If unable to do so, delivery would be made on Feb. 4 in the afternoon.6.	Second attempt was made at around 6:15pm Mountain time, same incorrect reason for not delivering.7.	At 9:39pm Eastern, I received an email saying that the package was ready for pick up.This is totally unacceptable.  The customer service agent advised that the driver’s first attempt was to the wrong location.  The driver obviously went to the wrong location on the second attempt as well because the tracking shows “receiver unavailable” again, even though the receiver was at home waiting for the package to be delivered.  The driver was told to call when he arrived, and the receiver would come downstairs to sign for the package.  Instead, a text was sent because the driver was too lazy to call.  The package was designated “signature required”.  The receiver only received a text telling him the package was available for pick up, no phone call.Now the receiver is expected to drive all the way to the Purolator Shipping Centre at the north end of Calgary to pick up this package, that was supposed to be delivered to his front door.I am extremely disappointed in Purolator's service.  I understand that there are delays and staff shortages, but this is just plain incompetence.  The only way Purolator can fix this is to deliver this package after 12 noon Mountain time, to the correct address on the waybill, and have the driver call the receiver when he gets there so the package can be signed for and handed to him in person.  Maybe it would be a good idea to send a different driver so he or she actually goes to the correct address.Please make sure you address this issue promptly.  The documents in this package are very important and time sensitive, as well as being highly confidential in nature.Thank you.Date of experience: February 04, 2022"

I ordered something and shipped it to a shipping facility near me to avoid a missed package, and for what ever reason probably out of sheer laziness they brought it to a purolator facility far away from me. They couldn’t even drop it at a purolator location near me?  I contacted purolator 3 different times to correct the address because I had a funny feeling about it and I found out today they ignored all my requests and shipped it right back to the receiver. Customer service wasn’t of any help either. So just a heads up... Apparently a delivery address means nothing and don’t even bother putting in a request for redelivery because it leads to no avail. It’s best to just go pick it up wherever they decide to drop it off.

Used Purolator's Virtual Assistant which is a total disaster.  Very user unfriendly and almost impossible to get results for my request.  After 1/2 an hour of trying to reschedule, the tool appeared to accept my request and indicated that the new delivery date is good.  There was no email or text message forwarded to me indicating that anything went through and was accepted.  Used Live Chat to verify with a customer rep that the re-schedule worked and she verified that it did.....""The package is on the truck for delivery"", said Cynthia.  Guess what?  There was nothing brought to my door at the requested date.  The tracking info shows that my package is still at the company's depot awaiting my pickup.  Tried contacting an agent by phone.....this turned out to be another futile attempt.  On hold for what seemed like an eternity before I disconnected.The next time that I order something online, I'll check to make sure that Purolator is not the courier used.Update - Jan. 27/22 - told by Purolator agent that redelivery requests can take from 24-48 hrs. and that I should register to receive email notifications re: the delivery.

My wife just called me at work - out of breath and very upset. The Purolator driver had arrived with  four 10kg boxes, but refused to bring them to our front door. My wife pleaded with him, telling him she had health issues, but he just turned his back and walked away while she was in mid-sentence. What rude, callous behavior! EVERY other carrier brings deliveries to our door. What a horrible driver and useless company.TRACKING #: 607962659381Date of experience: January 12, 2022"
794,Rebecca Fry,"Purolator’s service does NOT existPurolator’s service does NOT exist! I expected and paid for expedited delivery because it was Covid tests for travel so it was time sensitive. When tracking the pkg it said it was delivered (at 6:11pm) and 3 mins later (6:14pm) said it couldn’t be delivered as the address needed a unit number. My address is a house so no unit number is required and I double checked the address to ensure it was correct. I used the bot to redirect the pkg for pickup to their suggested place but when I got there found it was closed until Jan. 4th. Then Purolator was closed as it was Jan. 1st - closed?! I spoke to a rep in Jan 2nd and she said it was a contractor who was supposed to deliver and they often scan the pkg as delivered before leaving their truck!?? She said she redirected the pkg to be delivered the next day. I tracked it again and found the same message - ‘needed a unit number’. I was so mad!!!! Purolator customer service was closed on Jan. 3 (a New Years fell on a Sat. When they we’re also closed) I called customer service again on Jan. 4th (as they we finally open) and was told the previous agent had NOT redirected my pkg. I got them to hold the pkg and picked it up at their depot at the airport. Their incompetence and disregard for their contract to deliver next day cost me almost $400 (unnecessary Covid home test + cost of lab testing) as well as time and hassle. I recommend using ANY other courier service!Date of experience: January 12, 2022"
795,Stacey Smith,"Customer service is sub par follow up editCustomer service is sub par, trying to reach a real person is an arduous process which seems to be designed to make you give up after waiting an hour at a stretch.  As a business owner we often use courier services for deliveries, but purolator will never get our business again.  Paid  for overnight delivery from Vancouver to Vancouver island for a furnace motor on behalf of a client who had no other source of heat.  8 days later in the coldest snap we’ve had in years it finally shows up.  This is after calling in multiple times, trying to find out why it was held for six days in a depot an hour away, despite the fact that all the other couriers still managed to make deliveries in spite of the weather.  I explained to the customer service rep how urgent this delivery was, the elderly couple who  needed their furnace repaired had no other source of heat and we needed that delivery asap, they couldn’t even reach out to the driver who had it on board but was taking it to the wrong address to reroute it.  Since then I’ve reached out again to see about a partial refund, and all I get is silence.  Never will we use them again.Just an update on the issue we had with Purolator, I reached out to the address given and was told again that it was due to natural disaster and they had a no refund policy.  I emailed back and pointed out the fact that the motor sat in a depot an hour away from here for six plus days.  There was no natural disaster between here and there, I could have gone and picked it up myself.  The next email from Purolator was ""Landslides"".  Ummm...no.  No landslides.  Snow.  We had snow.....and yet all the other companies we deal with were STILL delivering.  Once again I email back and tell them there were no landslides between here and the depot.  Their next excuse was ""Well, there are issues with delivery in other parts of your province....so we couldn't help it.""  Ok, so first it's natural disasters (snow) then it's landslides (500 plus km away) and absolutely no way to reach anyone on a local level to arrange for pickup myself in order to get these people heat?  I'm sorry but that's not ok.  And since my last email I once again get nothing from them but silence.  Buyer beware, you pay for overnight shipping and this is what you get if you use purolator.  No apologies, no refund, just excuses.  I'll never again use purolator for anything after this.Date of experience: January 12, 2022"

800,Ken Simon,"I also wish there was an option for 0 starsI also wish there was an option for 0 or negative stars.I periodically get packages shipped to me by vendors. What I hate to see is the email that comes in with the tracking number, indicating it has been shipped via Purolator.Puro(much, much)lator will then give incomplete, incorrect, or inaccurate information on the tracking page. They may or may not leave it sitting in a warehouse for days, or possibly a week or more as my current shipment is doing.When they do finally decide to deliver it, there are a number of possible outcomes.1. Tracking page will show no information, but the parcel has been delivered, or2. Tracking page shows delivered a day or so ago, but  it has not actually arrived.3. There will be a ""Missed delivery"" where the driver indicates there was a problem (no answer, not home, incorrect address) when it is simply not true.4. On occasion the package will be delivered on time and undamaged. I suspect this is caused by a mistake being made.Now they are saying there is a 5 day delay for all packages going to BC, even though the real driving delay is a few hours. They also used that excuse on a package that was already in BC, just 45 minutes from my home. It seems they will use any excuse, real or imagined, to NOT deliver in a reasonable time.If there is an option to NOT use them, then don't. If they are the only option, thank about going to pick it up instead.Edit: As I read through the reviews I am struck with how often Poo-o-later leaves a notice, or even worse, does not leave the notice indicating no one was available or some such, even when people are at home and waiting. When I worked in Calgary, this was the normal practice when P was asked to deliver to one of the offices I worked in. When a person pushed the very well marked buzzer on our front door, ALL the phones in the office would ring. And yet, Purolator normally said that there was no response. This happened at least half the time. And it was always the same driver.Date of experience: January 10, 2022"

802,Al Kyle,"Do not ship with purolator, you have been warnedDo not ship with Purolator. Most of my packages that were delivered or shipments that I sent out were damaged. Insurance claims is a disaster and they would only grant the claim if you bought the label with a signature which would incur additional cost. Also they would not hold the packages to the closest customer pickup past the reattempts for example an attempt after  business hours or no buzzer code in a multi-dwelling homes . This is a disaster because they would return the shipment to the sender, which will incur additional costs and two, customer/receiver will not get the package. More profit for them in this case. They have the lowest reattempt count, Only one day. Other big courier companies offer 3 days to reattempt.  If you want to get your package in one piece or arrive avoid Purolator.

My husband is recovering from surgery  and needs his mattress. We ordered the bed frame at the same time and have had it for weeks. The big trucks have been up and down my road daily. I keep getting updates, this mattress has been transferred so many times it is ridiculous. Last night said it would be delivered by 8pm. At 7:38 said your package may be lost. Tracking no. IsEHJ000084120. I think Purolator employees are keeping packages for themselves. This is the 3rd time that they have lost packages in the past. Amazon doesn’t  know what’s going on.We are seniors, home everyday and have a note on the door to leave packages. If they can transfer a bed in a box to different trucks for weeks then they should be able to deliver.

I did not get a call to buzz in a delivery nor were any ""failed delivery"" instructions left by the delivery person.    This is about the fourth time out of 5 that the same thing has happened.  It seems that the delivery person doesn't even get out of the truck, just says recipient unavailable and drives on.  To make things much worse, had I not tracked the deliver on line, I would never have known that the delivery was ""attempted and failed"".  I went on line and asked for it to be delivered a second time.  This delivery was schedule for December 29.

815,MACISUS,"How pathetic that takes over 3 weeks for next day delivery just because the drivers don’t want to do their jobs!Seriously. I paid for next day delivery. They got the package December 16th with delivery scheduled for December 17th.  I was in a bad car accident so I can’t move too fast so I spent all day in my kitchen waiting so I wouldn’t miss the driver. At 9;30 pm I went out to make sure the chickens and goats are away and put my garbage out for next day and found a note on my gate less than 35 yards from my front door stating they were unable to do delivery.  Really? You could easily see my house and the lights were all on. That’s bs that I wasn’t available.  I called and asked W T F happened and told them there was no way I could drive 40 min to pick up package from airport just because their driver didn’t want to do his/her dammed job. They said they were sorry but since it was Friday they won’t be able to do Redelivery until Monday.  Fine.  Total bs but I’ll patiently wait.  I waited all Monday in my kitchen but no attempt was made.  I also had been getting 3-6 emails every day since Friday evening saying my package would be waiting for 5 days.  I called Saturday to see if they first agent screwed up but according to person on phone it’s an automated system and they will put a note.  But the emails came every day.  There was no change on package being at airport waiting for pickup even though I called every day that week to ask what’s going on. Exactly a week later on the next Friday I got a call from an k radio number (I’m in British Columbia) that I missed and called right back and texted back with no reply. I still don’t know who called but to be nice let’s say it was the driver…maybe.   Purolator site updated to say attempt was made. It wasn’t.  It had snowed and I went out to check but there was no footprints or tier marks in my driveway, near my gate or even on the street at my mailbox so no attempt was made to even come down my street! I called and asked wth is going on. Rush next day delivery a week later there was only one attempt made.  The following week still no package.  And yesterday 3 weeks later the site updated that my package was out for delivery. Want to take a guess what happened?  Nothing. The website didn’t even update to say unable to deliver or anything. It’s now Tuesday and the site updated at local facility. Then our for delivery. How can a company who’s entire business model is prompt deliver and their motto even is “it’s not just a package it’s a promise” not deliver?  At this point shouldn’t a supervisor be getting in a vehicle and hand delivering?  ‘All I can say is none of my friends or family, my company or any company I’m partnered with will EVER use such a bad company again.  I’ve had bad delivery company’s with Amazon such as intercom.  Up until this point they were the worst I’ve ever dealt with (courier, postal, or package service) but by comparison when their drivers make no effort to deliver (I have camera footage of a driver not even getting out of their vehicle but instead throwing a package marked fragile AT my car and if I hadn’t done my daily walk around that day would have run over my fragile package) they at least reply to messages or pick up phone and get it resolved within 2 days.  I’ve always gotten my package.  But purolator has lost my $500 rush package and isn’t willing to admit it or worse possibly their drivers don’t want to do their job so just say unable to do deliver.  Never will I use them again and will gladly pay more to use any other service out there.

832,sarah vazzoler,"Deliver guy has my package, said ""delivered"" and no one is doing anything to check in with him.I ordered a shipment from Amazon, and for some reason they decided to deliver it from Purelator, despite their history of bad services. Well, of course, they disappointed. All they had to do is bring my parcel from Guelph, ON to Waterloo ON, a 30 MIN drive if there's traffic. It was supposed to be a same-day delivery. 2 days ago they put the package as ""Delivered"". It wasn't. I contacted their customer service and they told me the package says it's delivered. I told them it was not delivered. They said sometimes the delivery guy says ""delivered"" BEFORE they actually deliver it, and I should just wait. Well I waited and the package has not arrived, so after contacting them again they said I should get in contact with the seller.For why? YOUR employee has MY package, he LIED about delivering it (essentially stealing it) and now you guys won't get in contact with him...?????Date of experience: December 16, 2021"
833,Yurii Kartuzov,"This is the most awful creviceThis is the most awful service. My parcel had been sent out from Quebec, then came to Toronto and by MISTAKE had been re-directed to Quebec again. 2 weeks passed, I'm still without my parcel. I called to the customer service and they're always lying to me, that parcel should arrive the next day or two. I asked to open a claim, but they refused to do it. Instead of that, a lady from the customer service advised me to contact with sender and withdraw the shipping costs from him. Why? Maybe Purolator needs to hire more intelligent people, who can read the address properly and maybe know the difference between Saskatchewan and Quebec?

835,Brian,"Extremely poor service by PurolatorI had a parcel picked up at a Toronto location on Dec 1, 2021 which was picked up by Purolator the same day. It arrived in Kelowna on Dec 7 and placed on the truck for delivery the same date. It was scanned again at the sorting facility within 23 minutes of being scanned on the delivery truck.  On Dec 8 it was scanned for delivery, later that afternoon it was scanned indicating ""Delayed in transit due to road/highway closure. Note it was already in Kelowna and there was no road closure which would have delayed delivery.  On Dec 9 it is scanned at the sort facility and back on the truck for delivery.  In less then a hour it shows, transferred to shipping center and within 45 minutes it's  available for pick up at the counter.  I was home all day there was no attempt to deliver the package to my residence, not was there a notice left that it could be picked up at a depot.  I called customer service and did speak to a live body.  I had asked the parcel to be put back on the truck and delivered on Dec 10.  I was told it was too late and could not be re-scheduled on delivery on Dec 13th. The CR said she would make the appropriate entry in the system and I would have my package on Dec 13.  I was told it was at the depot in West Kelowna.    I had been charged for delivery and I expected Purolator to fulfill their obligation to deliver the package and not for me too do their job and drive to the depot to pick it up.  On Dec 13 the package had not arrived and when I checked the tracking information there was no indication that the package had been re-scheduled for delivery, matter of fact it, still showed it could be picked up at the counter, again no address. I called the West Kelowna depot \enquiring about the package but was told they didnot have anything in my name.  I called Purolator again and spoke with one of the representatives who was apologetic.  This was the fifth day it had been at the depot and I was concerned it would be returned to the sender.  I asked which depot the package was been held and I was assured it was in the Main depot in Kelowna.  I made a special trip into Kelowna to pick up the package that should  have been delivered by Purolator 4 days hence.  When I arrived at the Kelowna depot, I was informed they did not have the package.  The Purolator representative called the West Kelowna depot and confirmed the package was still there.  Not only had I wasted my time by driving into Kelowna and back to West Kelowna ( 50 kms) to retrieve my package, something that Purolator had been compensated for to deliver.  I am extremely disappointed in the service that Purolator is providing. I believe for whatever reason the delivery driver did not make any effort to deliver the package to my house and he would just drop it at the depot which was easier.

Gave Purolator all tracking numbers pictures of content proof of sending. Purolator confirmed the boxes had been sent but there had not been delivery and concluded to lost items. A link was provided to go to next step. When I entered all info got an instant message that package had been received. Tried phoning, emailing replying to customer service survey...no answer back! No refund! no service! All their messages mention how they care for the clients which is not at all what they are demonstrating.UPDATE AFTER REPLYING TO PUROLATOR'S COMMENT BELOW:Had to share how Purolator are incompetent and this will conclude my experience. After getting their invitation to correspond with them I was asked once again to send (which I did)  proof of dropping off the boxes (Purolator shipment proof), proof of content in boxes; proof of purchase; proof of shipment numbers. Did receive answers from customer care. Corresponded with more than 5 people from customer care (who do a wonderful job but have no control over final decision). They sent me a pin# after declaring lost items (3 times)  and inviting me to file a lost claim report which I did.Their answer is:As you may know, Purolator's practice is to scan all shipments tendered to it immediately upon receipt and at various stages of transportation, including upon delivery. After a thorough investigation, we were unable to find any scanning activity in our records pertaining to your shipment. Consequently, we are confident that your shipment was never tendered to Purolator for carriage and must, therefore, decline liability.Please note that had your claim not been declined, Purolator's liability in this instance would have nonetheless been limited to $2 per pound or the declared value entered on the bill of lading (if higher).Should you have any questions or other information relevant to our investigation, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.Yours truly,Purolator Inc.A polite way to tell me I am lying!I give up! I am so surprised that Purolator are still in business with all the other carriers doing such a wonderful job. NEVER will do business with any company that is dealing with PUROLATOR nor use them.

I can't believe this is the service that I receive from Purolator…I had a shipment delivering to my home on last Monday, Nov 22nd, I wasn't home so the driver left a notice card indicate it can be picked up the next day after 10 am at the west Edmonton depot. I went there the next day around 4:30 pm, my package was not there and the staff advised me to contact Purolator to have it redelivered. I contacted an online agent on Tuesday evening, the agent submitted a relidvery request for me, but has noted that up-to-date scan info has been missing for my package so have filed a tracing case for me. On Wed, the tracking info shows it was out for delivery in the morning, but shortly it states ""Weather delay"", although the weather was absoultly fine in Edmonton on that day. In reading the Purolator Google reviews, I found that the ""Weather delay"" excuse was commonly used by Purolator to manipulat with customers when the weather is just fine. On Thur there was no update. On Fri, the tracking info shows it was out for delivery again in the morning, but then been dropped off to a Medi Drug location in Northeast of the city?! I'm in the west end, It is literally 30 mins / 40 kms one-way drive from my house. I contacted tracing specialist again, and have been told that my redelivery request is still pending, they contacted the depot to have it recovered and redlivered but no follow-ups whatsoever. I'm finally tired of waiting and decided to drive to the Northest Medi Drug location to pick up my package on Sunday, but I drove all the way there only found out it is closed on Sunday, with the info clearly states it's open 12-5 pm on Sundays on the Purolator site!Now it has been the second week. On Mon Nov 29th there was no updates. On Tue, tracking shows it was redirected and out for delivery in the morning, but in the evening it states “Address correction required - incomplete / incorrect address provided”Seriously, I can’t image what other excuses can be made up to cause further delays… Help me understand that why Purolator left a notice card on my door with the correct address on Nov 22nd and claim the address to be incorrect now?!On Wed again there was no updates. On Thur Dec 2nd, tracking shows it was out for delivery again in the morning, so I’ve been desperately waiting for it all day. Around 5:40 pm, I saw a Purolator truck parked at my neighbor’s house so I ran out as I have no more trust with this company and its  drivers. Sure enough, by that time he already went to the wrong house to try to deliver my package with the notice card left on my neighbor’s door! I showed him my tracking # and info on my phone and he finally gave my package to me.

Absolute joke of a ""service"".Tried to deliver my Christmas tree - left a notice giving me the pick up location, drive all the way there to find out it's at a different location. The location they brought it to is open 9-4 Monday to Friday... Which is a joke if you have a job. I call and have them reattempt delivery since my nanny is at the home. They never showed.. and brought it back to the pick up location with god awful hours. I call to have them redirect it to a different location with hours I could actually get to without missing work. THEY NEVER REDIRECTED IT. So I called again and asked them AGAIN to redirect it and now? Nothing. Still at that horrible pick up location - not being redirected, and every time I try to contact them it's too busy and the useless robot chat is telling me they want to CHARGE ME MORE. Like are you serious??? Horrible, HORRIBLE company.Date of experience: November 30, 2021"
877,Katerina Vopalkova,"Purolator is terriblePurolator is terrible! Their packages are always delayed, mostly ""due to weather conditions"" even if you order something in the middle of the summer when it does not rain at all.They can't keep track of their packages. When you talk to their customer service, they don't know where the package is and can't give you an estimate date of delivery and ask you to literally keep staring into your computer and check if anything updates.Their online tracking system shows outdated information - for example it tells you that the estimate date of delivery is today, when they clearly know they won't be able to make it. Either improve your tracking system or just don't provide it at all and just call people when you deliver. By the way you can't even ask to be called and give them your phone number before your package is out for delivery.I understand that stuff happens and the logistics get impacted (like the recent BC floods). I would be totally understanding if Purolator ever properly notified me and gave me a reasonable explanation as well as proper estimates. But I guess that's too much to ask from them. Can't believe big companies like Amazon or Dell ever pick these guys.Date of experience: November 29, 2021"

891,Janice Primeau,"Hands down purolator is the worstHands down purolator is the worst. With one exception. His name is Jamie and he does the saskatoon out towards spiritwood leoville run. Excellent service and excellent delivery record. He is the exception to purolators long list of crappy service.Now to today's issue at hand. I ordered a mini fridge for my 80 yr old mom on oxygen and can only use walker to get to bathroom which I put a door in-between her room and bathroom. She can't get to the kitchen. I had to go back to work so needed the fridge for her room so can leave her food and drinks. Stated delivery by 19th. Had I know when purchased that purolator was shipped I would have bought elsewhere. It was loaded onto truck 17th then got the weather notice and 22cnd says back on truck. However talked to purolator this morning and it is in warehouse in Richmond still. Maybe by this next Friday she says. So my mom should go hungry extra week nice I said. So she tries to tell me due to floods no way out of richmond. Nice try. We had a 2 day delay of our semitrucks for the event Glow at praireland that runs all through December. So I tell her obviously those trucks made it from Vancouver here. Then she says we'll large parcel volume also delay. Tells me call bestbuy see if they can replace it...but don't tell them you know trucks came through to saskatoon already!!! Why so your newest handy excuse seems credible?Last winter I ordered a snowblower. Unfortunately purolater as well. It was week late. Then showed on truck out for delivery 3 days in a row then at depot with no updated delivery date. Called the depot and got told well they ran out of time each of those 3 days to get it delivered and now was somewhere in a storage shed out back. I said get it out I will come pick it up. Was snottily told he didn't know where in the shed and they weren't pulling out all the parcels to find one parcel. I told him get his shovel and get over and start shoveling then. He said not his fault or problem. I told him was about to be. I Googled purolator ceo list and called. Magically 2 hrs later a truck pulled up and dropped off my ""can't get it out of shed"" snowblower. The excuse for original delay was covid of course. Again crappie service for years before covid but handy excuse. Now blame floods....but somehow other transports have made it from Vancouver to saskatoon. Intelicom express has yet to let me down. The one time they made a mistake they owned it and fixed it right away. No bull excuses. Mistakes happen but when you pass out lame excuses like candy instead of solving problems then you have both awful delivery and awful service. Next time I see anything I just ordered come up with a purolator shipper I will immediately cancel the order. I will not shop with companies that use purolator anymore.

In the evening the status changed to delivery failed due to Road closure. There is a construction in front of my house. Purolator havent even tried to go from the back street and drop off the package and just drove off and marked the delivery as unsucessful. interestingly enough drivers of Canada post and fedex were able to figure it out and my packages were delivered. Magic? No. Just a customer service. - Monday Nov 1 - called them to see whats going on and how to get my package. I was asked If I can give instructions for delivery which I did (go from the back street and call me, I ll come to get a package). Of course non of this has happened - Tuesday Nov 2 - called them again. i was that they do not see any instructions recorded with my tracking number. Also I was told that driver dont care About instructions anyway and is not going to call me (Seriously? What is this? Customer service????) and I am like ok so what I am suppose to do . And they say they can instruct driver to drop it off at the pick up location closest to my house. I confirmed the address of location several times and I was told my package will be there on Thursday Nov 4. Thursday Nov 4 - got a notification that my package was dropped off.

So I called AGAIN - I was told they made a mistake (lol really?????) and my package will be at the location I asked for tommorrow Friday Nov 5 Friday Nov 5 - just recieved a call from driver saying it wont be there today and bunch of excuses. They basically accused me of THEIR mistake saying the package was dropped off at the location closes to me (lol lol lol - the one I wanted my package to be delivered is 1 Km from my house, the other one when they actually dropped it off is almost 7km away, so whats closest?) when I argue that this is not true I was being constantly interrupted and at the End I was hung up on. Like I was talking and the person hung up. I was not vulgar, I havent used swear words. But They still hung up on me. Because I was trying to get my package and make them own their mistakes.

I basically spent way more money than I was planning to going to pick up the package after they said they’d deliver it since I offered detailed instructions so that they’d have no excuse to say they tried to deliver it and I wasn’t home. Terrible service, very disappointing.Date of experience: October 28, 2021"

I was inquiring about an expected deilvery since I just approach to the front entrance and saw him jumping to his truck and not wanting to miss the shipment I asked him for package addressee info to see if he had any for me as I gave him my name and unit #.

936,Vid S.,"Lightweight trying to play with the heavyweightsJanuary 2021 Purolator picked up a parcel from a supplier to be delivered 3.5 km. to me. 22 lbs. and bigger than a breadbox. 7 - 10 days. The justification - it was large.October 2021 Purolator picked up a parcel from a supplier to be delivered 9.4 km. to me, the next day. 71 lbs. and bigger than a breadbox. 5+ days? The justification - it was heavy.After picking up this ""too heavy"" package and taking it to the Toronto sort centre, within 1 hour they handed it off to a 3rd party. Purolator customer service didn't even know who the 3rd party was saying ""only the depot knows"".This is a very sad state of affairs. I don't buy their excuses and believe that if you can't deliver then be adult enough to admit it and don't pick up things, from the supplier, that you can't deliver on time.Handing your job off to a 3rd party does not absolve you of your responsibilities.In both cases Purolator, knowing full well that they wouldn't be delivering it on time, did not notify me, or the supplier, of any delays. I had to message and call  to even get an answer and/or clarification.Date of experience: October 27, 2021"

Anytime I see Purolator shipping when I order Amazon I immediately just cancel my order because it’s not worth it these people are absolutely insane and they are a liars. They say attempt delivery when in fact they haven’t even stepped out of their truck. I waited at home for two days constantly looking out my apartment window to see a Purolator truck and then all of a sudden I get an email saying attempted delivery and no one actually came so they either just sit in the truck and drive by peoples houses and lie or they are just ghosts. I’m convinced these people don’t even exist or there’s just ghosts driving their vehicles my boyfriend never believed in ghosts but he’s started to believe in them now. The customer service is complete trash every single person we spoke to about our delivery was completely rude and talked to me as if I was on the spectrum. Who would want to work for Purolator when all they do is probably just get complaints all day. Whenever I order From Amazon and I see that Purolator is the shipper I wait until it says out for delivery and then just cancel my order so they can get a taste of their own crap.

They ""attempted"" a delivery to the addressee and then just dropped the boxes at pinguinpickup without leaving a note or otherwise informing us of the delivery. Only when i called in they bothered to let me know. Is that how they provide the service customers paid for????And the story doesnt end here. Of 4 boxes, they only delivered 3. The 4th missing box- they cant even advise where it is.They received all boxes at the same time, and while they saw boxes 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, it never even caused them to think where is the fourth box in the shipment and why it is missing. I was only informed of this by the addressee that the next day delivery was still not delivered 10 days after. I called them on Oct 7 and nobody was able to tell me where the box is. Again, it was supposed to be the next day delivery, meaning the order was supposed to be delievered on Sep 30. Not only they did not fulfill their order, the service they were paid for, they didn't bother to deal with the missing package at all. They only started working on it when apparently push came to shove. Only when the customer called in they slowly started to working on it. In other words, they did not fulfill the service and didn't do anything about it in hopes that the customer won't notice-? and they can get away with it-?Other than that I can not think of any reason why they didn't finish the order and decided to leave it hanging. When on Oct 7 I called, only then they decided to start doing smth about it, and they told me ""good that you called so we can start the investigation"". You should have started the investigation regardless of my call if you didn't fulfil the order. The packaged has been missing for 2 weeks now and they still didn't do anything about it. Only ""oh, we started the investigation, our investigation specialist will call you"". You called a couple of times and inquired of the status - well, we started the investigation and within 2 days - still no progress, we kept the status quo, but we started the investigation, it is all in our notes!

967,Susie,"Shipment problem finally ResolvedDelphine from Purolator's Social Media Customer Care Section reached out to me 13 minutes after my original One Star review for Purolator's delivery service. The Customer Care Section was thoroughly professional and worked to resolve my delivery problem.My package arrived at my apartment door this Friday late morning. The Social Media Customer Care Section of Purolator gets  5 Stars from me. If the Delivery Section and the Agents handling the Service section were as professional,  Purolator would have gotten a much better positive review.Because of the vastly different service I got from Purolator, I have revised my final review to 3 stars, balancing the two.My original review stands as follows:Worst delivery service I have ever encountered.  Basically to the point where if I knew the company I am ordering from is using Purolator, I would definitely not purchase from them.My Purolator nightmare is still on going and I have no idea if it will ever be resolved. Shipment I ordered from Michaels was split into two packages, one arrived okay. The other shipment encountered mechanical problems on Monday, its scheduled delivery day and there would be a delay.  Since I signed up for all notifications and am especially vigilant since this was Purolator, I was on top of this and called Purolator on Monday to request for delivery on Wednesday instead as Tuesday was the one day I had a medical appointment on and to make sure it would not arrive on TuesdayWell, of course delivery was attempted on Tuesday and I was left with the Purolator notice that my package was now left for pick upThe whole reason I had requested Wednesday delivery was because I have no transport and am on a walker. It is impossible for me to drag the parcel from the pick up point back  uphill to my home.I called Purolator again and was assured that package was on van for re-delivery to me Wednesday morning. However when I checked again, later in the day, I saw that it said its held for pick up at pick up location. So called Purolator again and was told that the previous two agents I spoke to, did not do a proper job and I should have been told re-delivery would need to be approved.So, this time, the 3rd agent told me, he had put up a note on this matter on file and that on Thursday, my package would be picked up to return to sort facility and if I am lucky, it would be sent to me same day, but if not, on Friday for sure, package would be on the van out to meWell, on Thursday, I went to check if my package had been picked up to return to sort facility but of course it had not. It is still being held for pick upI once again called Purolator and spoke to the 4th agent and this time he told me that the driver at the pick up location said my apartment buzzer was not working. I have no idea why it would not be working for Purolator when Fed EX and Amazon had no problems using the buzzer and delivering packages to me this last Wednesday and today, Thursday.Purolator driver must be something special.Anyhow, this 4th agent, managed to contact pick up point and requested for a redelivery and told me its too late for Thursday but they would deliver on FridayShortly after, a 5th Purolator agent called to say that driver has finished his rounds for my area and earliest delivery would be next week Tuesday and suggested that I go to pick up location to pick it up myself!By which point, I told the agent that I am beyond frustrated and if it cannot be re-delivered to me come Tuesday, Wednesday whatever, next week, they can send it back to the sender.I have never had an experience as bad as this with any courier company. I would never use Purolator myself and again, if I knew Purolator is the  delivery service the company I am shopping from is using, I would definitely forgo the shopping or find another store to purchase from.Date of experience: October 07, 2021"

Single exception was Purolator (for cheap $10 item), and doing some digging on the internet, it seems the reason why Purolator never seems to just leave the package at door like all the other couriers, is that Purolator uses the OPT OUT method when the shipping label is created.  The box with ""Signature Required"" is checked off by default, whereas all other couriers use OPT IN, where the box is unchecked by default. Not only a very sneaky slimy way for Purolator to slip in an extra $1-2 per shipment to the shipper, but also causes delays for the customer and/or requiring item be picked up at Purolator depot.

992,Shobhit Dixit,"Delay in delivery and recommendations is to pay more for priority shipping next time!Where do I even begin, I ordered something from a website and they have me a Purolator tracking number. And I knew that they will screw it up, so my order was placed on Monday early morning with 2-3 day ground shipping. So I get an email that my package is delayed because it missed a ""connection"" and won't reach on Thursday. Now the new delivery day is Friday (today), however they have my address wrong. So in from of my home address it says ""Is *** ******"" (my home address) I don't get how you can accept an address which is wrong? Ok that is not even the worst part, after waiting for 40 min to get to customer care on Thursdays I gave them the correct address and they assured me that it will be delivered today. Surprise, surprise my order ""went out for delivery"" and at 4.20 pm local time I get an email update ""wrong address on the order, please contact customer care"". Now I call them again and wait for another 57 min to get a representative on call. They said "" I have a wrong address and they have no idea who I talked too and they didn't update the address!"" But wait there is more!!!!!!!!!So the new rep said the best he can do is ""set the newly delivery date to Monday"" and I offered to drive 34km one way to puck my package if I can get it today?! He put me on another 25 min hold to talk to his manager, his manager comes on and gives me another NEWS!My package address can not be changed because of the agreement in place with the seller, so her recommendations was to call the original buyer and ask him ""To ship me a new package as this will take longer to sort out, and would be better to place a new order and pay for express shipping"".... Wait what??? So after delaying my order now your recommendation is to spend more money and pay more to Purolator so they can ship it fast because they messed up the delivery and can't fix it soon enough??? How is this company still in business?? They have more than 90% reviews below 1 start and all they do is mess up orders regularly? I am a reasonable individual, and I understand right now labor market is struggling and it's hard to find people to work. However, if the top management have to implement proper procedures in place. Atleast that would help make front line staff and workers life MUCH EASIER!!!! And they won't have to deal with angry and pissed off customer. If you can't do that, may be it is good that a company like Amazon is entering shipping and logistics industry to be a 3rd party delivery company. As they know what customer service and a delivery company is and supposed to be like. I am sorry Purolator, but you are the worst company in delivery and logistics.

997,Annebelle McGowan,"I am a Purolator / Bloomex CustomerI am a Bloomex customer who use Purolator to deliver their floral arrangements. Purolator has an agreement with Bloomex that waives responsibility for the condition of the flowers when they arrive because they know their trucks and delivery times are not appropriate for flower delivery. Purolator pickup up and transported my flowers from North York to North Bay (over 300km) during a 30 degree heatwave. It took half a day... my flowers were put in their warehouse and not supposed to be delivered until Monday. That would have made them a floral soup. They do not have refrigerated trucks. When I complained to Bloomex and wanted a refund they said 'No' because it was Purolators fault. When I contacted Purolator they said it was Bloomex's Fault. Purolator is fully aware that they are unable to transport perishable items which is why they have Bloomex sign a waiver of responsibility. Thing is... this means Purolator is under no obligation to try and get the flowers there on time or in good condition. Bloomex now refuses all refunds. So.... have a look at the many Market Place Exposes and Purolators role in the Bloomex scandal and the Bloomex Sucks FB page before you decide to order from either company.  Eventually... I got my refund... but I was told it was on the last day that refunds were going to be available.  When I made my order with Bloomex it said a Local North Bay Florist would be used... they were not and I was not told that Purolator would be used. Bloomex used Purolator to transport the arrangement hundreds of km's in a heat wave and had my arrangement for FIVE days during that heat wave.  You are darn right Purolator and its drivers / employees know what they are doing. Shame on you Purolator!!!! My daughter never did get flowers for her birthday because of you. You knew when you picked them up what would happen. Thanks for ruining her day.

Several times in the past, they did not deliver packages citing incorrect address/missing information while others were able to deliver on time, and I had to personally collect it from their center. This time, it was again not delivered with same reason. When I contacted to get it picked up personally, I was told that they will hold it in their centre and I will be able to pick it up by today. I contacted the customer care 3 times to confirm the same. However to my utter surprise, I received an update citing that I need to make an appointment to get it delivered, and there was no mention of the pickup service I requested. Totally confused with no updates and no information whatsoever with the current status of my package. Worst ever service. not recommended at all!!![Update @3:49pm CDT 9/20/2021 post Purolator customer care reply]I have emailed back with the details to Purolator customer care in the email id provided, and waiting for a response.[**Update @7:00pm CDT 9/20/2021**] This is why I term Purolator service as most unprofessional and unworthy. In order to get attention that they are responding to customer complaints; just after I posted my experience, their customer relationship team posted publicly in this review, that they want me to send in the details, so that they can update me about the status. I did the same, I got a general reply from them as below ""We were unable to complete the delivery on Sept 18th as we didn’t have your buzzer code. A request to have this held for pickup was sent on the 18th,  and will be processed by the end of the day today, not over the weekend. As soon as its ready for pickup, the status will be updated.""

1005,Lance BL,"Purolator Express is slower and far less reliable than regular mail via Canada Post.I was going to write out my tale of woe with Purolator in detail but after looking at a few recent reviews, I see that there is nothing novel about my experience.  Very briefly, I had an envelope shipped express from Toronto to Vancouver last Friday.  A note was left on my door on Sunday saying that delivery had been attempted and I could pick it up the next day at a local store...Michaels on W Broadway.  I walked to Michaels and was told that it wasn't there, it had gone to the Richmond Depot.  Called Purolator and they asked if I could pick it up in Richmond....miles away from my home.  I said no, I don't have hours to spend because you made a error---please deliver it to me--or at the very least to Michaels asap. They said they didn't think they could do that the next day but they'd try the following one.  It didn't come within two days so I phoned again...they apologized but said it may take another two days to get to me.  The terminal there is very busy and running behind they said, apparently to make me feel better.  It would have been faster and more efficient...and a fraction of the cost and frustration...to have sent it by regular Canada Post mail.  If Purolator can't clear the backlog in its depots it should stop accepting parcels until it can---it's soliciting and accepting money for a service it has no ability to deliver.  I'm not a lawyer but I'm pretty sure that's fraudulent.  Finally, please don't respond Purolater with a comment asking me to send my tracking number so you can resolve the issue...every time I've phoned I've provided that.  Please just clean up your operation or close down your business.Update:  Purolator did not deliver the parcel within the second two day period either, despite the second promise.   I called and the parcel is being shipped back to the sender, the two promises over the phone to make good on their earlier mistake notwithstanding.  I called again and after 40 min on the phone the Purolator rep. said they will try to prevent the return shipment.  We'll see.Date of experience: September 16, 2021"

We waited for a couple of days for the phone call and on last Friday Sep 10 they sound the entry buzzer for delivery. Funny thing is that we had the call exactly 5 minutes before the buzzer. As nobody was home to receive the item they took it back. I called the agent/driver who left us message in the afternoon after getting back home and he said they are going to deliver it today Sep 13 after 3 pm but it was all words. They did not scan the item or whatever they have to do to update the website to show what is happening and still no delivery at 9 pm. God knows where the item is.

I was in one such situation in July and now today they dropped me a message that I missed the delivery so I need to pickup - pure rubbish. So the person never visits my building, so just an sms eod that failed attempt so pick up from the location. This defeats the whole purpose of home delivery - lazy delivery guys. So I ordered two items, one was from Canada post and another by Purolator. Both were showing to be delivered today almost same time. Canada post made it to my door step but Purolator, like always missed delivery. Indoor of me paying for home delivery, I need to go pickup from another location.

1014,Alana Lombardo,"Purolator drivers lack common sensePurolator drivers lack common sense. I had a package left by their driver in the vestibule of the lobby of my condo building. This building has about 500 residents. Obviously my package was stolen. There was no attempt to contact me. The shipper resends the package and I check the tracking to see if I can divert the package to a pickup location. I even spoke to customer service who called me to confirm where to send my package. It never gets updated and i only get an email saying ""sorry we couldn't deliver, we've transferred this to another courier"". A week goes by with no updates, and customer service also had no information. Today I get a notice that my order was delivered, but where? They sent back to the shipper. They claim that they couldn't deliver to my condo, they brought it to a pickup place and it wasn't claimed. I never received an email or call about this. (Yes i'm signed up and have received other emails. Their customer support was kind enough to treat me like a child and make me confirm signing up AND check my spam). So basically my package was sent twice and I didn't receive it. I contact them and it's no help. Now the store will only refund the part that they sent via purolator. But not the useless parts that ended up getting shipped and received from FedEx.In the end, Purolator has cost me $35, and way too much of my time dealing with this.

1015,Max Oliinyk,"Package supposed to be delivered on…Package supposed to be delivered on three separate occasions. PACKAGE STORY & INTRO: I live in a basement and there are 2 doors that you have to open before you can reach the basement doors. So, it is basically an apartment as it has separate entrance (this is important as the rep saying that the driver only calls if they do not know the apartment# or buzz code). For the third time Purolator just leaving the: ""We're sorry we missed you"" note and I am not receiving the package. I explained to the representative directions to knock my doors & that the driver has to call/notify me about the delivery. When I am calling to find out why package has not been delivered for the third time, the rep is saying: ""you know, drivers are extremely busy..."". Erm... If your driver cannot call the customer, they have to be able to notify the customer somehow WHEN they are delivering the package. If the customer is not outside waiting for you the whole day, there is no way you will deliver the package.COMPANY's SOLUTION: ""We will schedule a delivery and see how it goes"". REAL SOLUTION: Add YOUR DELIVERY IS HERE option for your drivers. I received a MISSED DELIEVERY text message three times. Let your IT team know that they have to add one more option for the driver to choose. Ask them wait there for 1 minute if it is 3rd time the package has not been delivered. Find a way to let the customer know when you are delivering the package. If they are not busy to press MISSED DELIEVERY button, they are not too busy press YOUR DELIVERY IS HERE option. Check your competitors, they are notifying customer about the delivery.CONCLUSION: Even though representatives wanted to help, nothing has changed.

I used the chat function on the purolator website and it said ""did you mean this address?"" with the other option for a postal code. I clicked yes, again it does not matter both postal codes work.

I called them and told them that I don't have the package and they just read what the tracking info said WHICH I ALREADY KNEW! Then they told me to call the shipper?!?!? How about you contact your driver to find out where it is?!?!**Update: Since writing this, Purolator reached out and it took a week, but they found the package. Apparently, the driver was new and didn't bother to read the address and thank goodness the security still had my package.

Every time I get a shipment from Purolater, it goes missing or they just put a delivery attempt notice slip on the door without calling me. I am home every time YOU GUYS ""attempt to"" DELIVER! BUT HOW COME I NEVER RECEIVE MY PACKAGE while I am home all day!!!!!!!!!!!! I am more frustrated today because I moved to a new apartment unit and was waiting for my new mattress from Amazon. I was home and didn't receive a call or knock on the door. The driver gave my package to some random guy named ""Phil Bestbay"". Is there anyone whose last name is Bestbay? Is he a fictional character to receive a package???? No signature. Just verbal confirmation?!!!?!?!?!?!??? Give me a break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I contacted Purolator for the wrong delivery. They say I need to wait for 5 days cause today is Friday. This is disgusting. If any online retailer uses their service, I have no respect for you.p.s. It arrived 5 days late than the expected delivery date. The package was left outside the lobby of my apartment building. My superintendent found it left to the public access(I live in downtown area).I already purchased a mattress from a local store. And the customer service rep said she will give me an update as to the whereabouts of the shipment. She sent me the update a few hours after the package was delivered. If they advised me the update immediately, I could have notified them I already made a purchase of mattress and return back to the sender. I already explained my situation to Purolator and they just sent the package to me. Now, I need to bring this mattress to UPS to return it to the sender. This weighs a lot and it will be a lot of trouble moving this to the drop-off location... They really screwed me up. I wasted my time communicating with them and waiting for the mattress and my back hurts. From now on, whenever I make a purchase from online retailer, I will ask them which delivery courier company they use. I will not buy anything if the company uses a delivery service from Purolator.Date of experience: September 04, 2021"

1031,Wazmo,"Purolator is awfulI wish I could simply request that Canada post of almost anyone else would deliver my orders from Amazon. Unfortunately this awful company ends up delivering most of my orders these days and I've had nothing but mixed service and frustration. Purolator will occasionally leave my packages at the door, which is fine. We live in a good neighbourhood and I'm not all that worried about packages disappearing, it hasn't happened yet and I always see the delivery update as soon as the package is delivered so I can go downstairs and grab the delivery. However they have now on multiple occasions decided to not leave the package and just drive away. I then contacted purolator the next day about my package and they had to ""reschedule"" either the delivery or pickup for another day and refused to let me drive to their sorting center and pickup my package myself even though I live only 29 minutes away. They admitted to me that the package was there, but would not allow me to pick it up? Makes absolutely 0 sense, and is probably one of the stupidest policies I've ever experienced. I'm completely fed up with purolator, they deserve every one of the bad reviews they have on here.Update!The package finally arrived today and the packaging for the guitar strings I ordered was ripped up and opened, and the box for my headphones had clearly also been opened. The best thing this company could do to respond to my review is stop existing, that's it. Bad service all around, I wish there were other options, unfortunately Amazon does not let you chooseDate of experience: September 02, 2021"

Next day, they delivered it at the postal office directly. Two days wasted waiting for a parcel that I'll have to take a cab to get because it's really heavy.

They had to call a store to check with them if they actually had the package or not because the tracking history said Purolator had picked up the package. When asked why they didn't deliver the package, this is their response: ""It is possible, however, that he went to the wrong address or buzzed the wrong number."".They ended up leaving my package in a store far away from my place. It's a 30min transit to get there. You loose 1hour of your time because they can't manage to call you or buzz you when they're in your area.

Every other order is the same problem, a few times my food has been spoiled because the order is taken to a purolator office where there's no fridge. So I need to take a bus to get it (which defeats the purpose of the whole delivery service); or wait until the next day until they can try to deliver it again.

None of them were delivered to me successfully in timely manner. For the very first delivery I waited for 1 month and had no update, no emails, no calls, no texts. Since all these deliveries are for my legal documents I almost felt depressed thinking what would have happened to my documents. also the matter was time sensitive. For the other deliveries I start keeping track and still they did not delivered it saying that there is no buzzer code to enter in building. for last three months there is a maintenance work going on in our building and hence they have written the buzzer code with big big letters at the entrance of the building. I don't understand how come you cant see that  buzzer code. The last one I had was the only successful delivery and that too because I literally seated on my door waiting entire day and communicated to support team constantly. I still have one more package to deliver and I will again have to seat on my door for entire day waiting for the shipment. I literally spent $45 for each delivery and on top of that I had to take day off every time just to wait for delivery.

On wednesday I call them again and said it did not come so the agent said it will arrive the next morning which didnt come. For a week they don't deliver my package due to ""high volume"". Mind you I live literally 10 minutes away from the sorting facility. So I called on friday to see if they deliver on weekends, and they say they don't.

Needless to say the DVD was in pieces for something that needs to be done right away.  Got in touch with the CHAT line, they told me to fill out a form.  What a load of crap.  You already made my life more complicated and now I have to fill out a form and then what?  It is not like they are able to replace what is on the DVD.  I asked to speak to a manager and I was promised a phone call back within 2 hours.  Well believe it or not no phone call back. And oh, now they are closed until tomorrow.  And the tracking number is 333030257476 - so don't send a response and say, ""Oh, I'm sorry, send me the tracking number and we will look into it.""  Apology not accepted.  Actually do something other than apologize.  You actually still charge me for this crappy service.  You should change your slogan to be ""It is a package that may or may not be delivered.  We do not guarantee any timeline and your package may or may not be in pieces when you receive it"" then at least it would be the truth.  And don't expect customer service as there is none.  Ever since people started working from home the wait times are crazy. I think people put you on hold while they do their laundry, watch TV, take the dog for a walk, vacuum, eat lunch, anything but doing their jobs.  I can't wait for a response, if any.Date of experience: July 15, 2021"
1122,Alexandre Lamarre,"First time dealing with purloator..First time dealing with purloator... They cannot figure out how to deliver a package to my appartment building. They claim they cannot find any way to do so. It's a pretty standard intercom at-the-door appartment building. They never contacted me through the intercom or even the building manager. They then called me at my personal number, telling me they have failed to deliver twice and telling me it's fault. I then try to explain its an intercom and on BOTH occasions the delivery driver did not use the intercom, but the person on the phone was just as incompetent. In the next episode, we'll find out if it will take them all week to figure this out.Date of experience: July 13, 2021"
1123,Arianna Berube-Saunders,"If I could give negative stars I would.If I could give negative stars I would. I never pick this company, I only ever deal with them when it is outside my control. I have even chosen to not shop from some retailers because they use purolator. I have been waiting for equipment from my job for over a week and it kept being delayed. They would email me saying that it missed the truck or it missed the switch. And when they finally had it out for delivery they never showed up and later sent an email saying it was inaccessible. I can see the front door of my building from my window. No one came, no one even drove by. How they figured it was inaccessible is beyond me. After waiting 45 minutes to talk to an actual person I was informed that, even though they are owned by canada post, they could not and would not drop my package at a post office. Or even the closest pick up location. No they would drop it off at the one across the city from me, and couldn't confirm if I would be able to pick it up as soon as they opened. Just that I would have to wait a day and track it on their site to see when in the day I would be able to go and pick it up. If I didn't need this for my job i would write it off. Rude unhelpful customer service agents who apparently cannot give a straight answer or be helpful in the slightest. And the drivers don't bother to even attempt a delivery. Do not recommend.

I was literally 2 meters away from the door ALL MORNING. It was a Friday, nice sunny day, Driver is thinking, why bother even bothering to deliver , they get paid either way, hit a button, say you tried to deliver LOL and get off early to enjoy the sunshine. NO notice on the door(management never bothers to check , they are a joke) Drivers run purolator apparently, management similarly is sleeping the day away on regular basis, from so many of this EXACT same complaint being posted all over Yelp, here and probably many other places. It would not be hard to track this, IF management cared. The call center would just have to ask if a notice was left, drivers could be flagged. But you know it's sooo much easier to just sleep the day away at the office.I waste my time calling to get delivery ""re-attempted"" LOL they never attempted EVER to date.. So she scheduled it for the next day they can, wait again around all morning. NOTHING!!!!!!!! Said it was ""On vehicle for delivery"" ends up being dropped off for ""Shipment available for pickup' NO ATTEMPTED DELIVERY!!!!! So great for the drivers, you can just slack off pile up a bunch of packages that you don't feel like delivering, then you get to just dump them off at the depot. AHHHHH yes another easy day in the life of a purolator driver. It's not like they have to actually prove they posted a notice of a delivery attempt on doors, management never checks. So much sunshine, maybe take a nap parked for awhile, maybe leave work early ahhh so relaxing. Packages, what packages LOLUpdateTheir response was a non-response. All she did was the very same check on shipping, I had already done on the internet, and gave no more detail than the website as to why the driver lied about making a ""delivery attempt"". I guess it looks better, that they responded to sound concerned, rather than a genuine concern to fix the problem.Date of experience: July 12, 2021"

To come to Canada to care for my family, I received permission from the Canadian Red Cross. Even though I was approved to enter Canada, I still needed to complete the federal guidelines and isolate 14 days. On day 8 I completed my second covid test on line with switch health (a federally contracted agency). I called purolator for a pick up of the test (per the guidelines and the contract they had with switch health). Pick up was scheduled and was picked up the next morning. It was an express package and was to be delivered to the lab the same day. It is 4 days later and it has not been delivered. And the test is no longer valid.

I have been home and available, waiting for most of these orders, and have never ever heard my door knocked, rung and they never leave a door knocker. It's always ""Oh! you missed the delivery and they couldn't leave a door knocker so go find out where your package ended up!""

Why offer fast shipping to people (both companies and residents) if you guys can't follow through with it. It's always the same BS excuse that has been used for YEARS. Why not fix the issue at hand. Why are we paying extra for fast shipping if you guys cannot simply follow through! Ordering things to be delivered on a certain week only to be told it'll come the following - rendering the item useless ! If you're a company, small business, or just a regular person try and find a different place to ship from if you can because it's not worth the waste of money nor the headache. You would think they would prioritize shipping packages that are marked as EXPRESS/FAST shipping. Until they fix this problem they will always be a trash delivery service. I wasted my time and money. Didn't even get in touch with someone on the phone (was on hold for 50+ minutes) had to resort to contacting one of their social media pages only to be told the fast 2 day shipping I paid extra for turned into 5 days.

1131,Jake,"Purolator you did it again...Purolator you did it again...A few years ago I had stopped ordering anything from any company that uses Purolator because I only had trouble in the past with this clown of a company (at least clowns are funny sometimes...) Purolator is the equivalent of the notorious killer clown, they get to your package kill it and bury it in their warehouse to never be found. June 29, 2021, to be fair, the first error did not come from Purolator, it was a shipping or administrative mishap from Amazon. At first, I called Purolator who informed me that the sender had not processed the pickup form required; good, no problem, hung up with them and proceed to call Amazon, we set replacement, and finally, I knew that I had to wait at least two additional days. But they guaranteed that the package would be at my place by yesterday June 8. It a chance that I work from home because whether go with the deficient bot chat, email notification or tracking system, you never ever get the right information. On the 7th it said that the estimated delivery time was on the 7th, then I realized after they finally updated that garbage of a website which they want us to rely on, the package was not on route to delivery, it was sitting at their Circus (warehouse).So the next day, I decided to call to find out when should I expect the package, which I was told because it's a heavy package it required special handling and this would create up to 4 days delay. You know, Purolator, one of the things that would make you a better company would be to ""actually"" provide detailed information on your website, your email notifications or anything so we, the client, won't spend all day waiting for something that will not be delivered. I am a business client from FEDEX and guess what; if they can't deliver on the promised day, I'll be notified by email with full details or I can go on their tracking system and get full details almost instantly. Yours, it will just display your estimated delivery time is such and such date, but nothing else. Now I know, that when I'll check your website again today it will say, estimated delivery for today, and tonight at 9 pm nobody would have shown up.I am not going to ask how you're still in business, because it's obvious, you are still in business because your shareholders keep on making money, as long as they keep making money you still can treat your customers like yesterday's diner. But there is one thing I will ask Amazon and it's to never ever use Purolator to deliver anything to me even if it was just a bag of sand, you'd manage to tell us it needs special handling and that I'll get it in three weeks, yet your tracking system will keep on telling me that it will arrive today, day after day for two weeks.There is a reason I was anxious when Amazon told me that Purolator was the delivery company, I said to myself ""OMG, here we go again..."" You really are in the wrong business, you should become a circus, but before you change your venue take an example from other business models that succeed. For example Le Cirque du Soleil.. they DELIVER... You don't!Date of experience: July 09, 2021"

I HATE that they don't leave your packages at the door if you don't answer. We waited around all day for our package only to be sent an email at around dinnertime stating they attempted delivery.

They told me that I was supposed to add 4 days to the estimated delivery date because the package was heavy and that the sending party should have told me that. What??? It's Purolator's own tracking website page that gave me that date, why can't they provide an accurate date on their own page?I asked for a trace to prove that they actually knew where my package was and was told they would call me back. I followed up the next day to see why they didn't call. I was told they were allowed 24 hours to return my call.

Three times now I have called to have no result, the virtual assistant won't recognize my address and whenever I try to chat with an operator it tells me there are no agents at any time of day. If my package gets returned AGAIN I am blacklisting this delivery service on anything I use and refusing to order from anywhere that uses Purolator.Date of experience: June 22, 2021"
1161,Jordi Santini,"Had them blacklisted by Amazon, thankfully.Amazon has chosen to send some of their packages through Purolator, and every time they have, it's been horrible.The delivery driver never rang the bell or knocked , but leaves a note that no one was home, which was a lie. The last time it happened, we even heard the delivery driver walk up to the door, -throw- the package (a TV) to the ground in front of the door, and left without even pressing the doorbell or knocking.We've contacted Amazon to put them on a blacklist for delivery to our address, and we've never had a single problem with another courier. Later we were contacted by an Amazon representative, and they asked if we'd like to forward our issue to higher management. I really hope they cancel Purolator's contract.Edit: as expected, a canned response. You do realize that every single time you paste a prefabricated response like that, it hurts your reputation and image more, right? It shows you do not care at all, and are aware of the problems, but refuse to fix them.Date of experience: June 22, 2021"

They just threw it somewhere in the mailroom and left without taking any proof that they delivered it. No picture, no signature. Nothing. The item was of course stolen immediately from some of the nice neighbors here in the condo. When we called customer service they said its not their responsibility. Its like they want the item to go missing so the shippers may pay for a signature service or something.. For all we know the courier themselves just took it with them home..

I was advised that as soon as I get the message stating it is due for delivery that day to call them ; they would advise the driver to call for directions. Guess what..... I have been waiting on hold for 30 minutes so far! I will be absolutely shocked if the box reaches my home.Stay tuned Purolator!Well still on ‘hold’ 40 minutes later.

The guy at the store (not a Purolator employee) , searched my package for 10 minutes and couldn't find anything.5. He informed me that this happens quite often that people arrive in the store and their package is not dropped off there.6. He advises me to call the 1-800 number which I did. After being onhold for 30 minutes , finally someone answers me and we try to locate my package , they tell me someone has attempted a new delivery again today which is another blatant lie.7. I tell him the delivery guys are not telling the truth and emphasize the terrible service from Purolator and he starts to scream.8.

I have spoken with the company 3 times on the phone and twice over the internet in the past 2 weeks to confirm the address (which was right all along, the sender gave them the correct information) and they still insist they do not have the right address. I've gotten the sender involved and they've opened an investigation, but yet again, my tracking number says they do not have an address and delivery is on hold. Literally 3 times this week I have confirmed the address. And two times the week before online. Every single time thy say 'yes, we have it now in full. Your delivery will be there tomorrow'. And yet again, I got another notification today saying they do not have the address. I am so angry. I just hung up after being on hold for an HOUR and no one even answered.

The first told me they will reschedule and request the package to be placed in the apartment front doors. Then, driver attempted next day and left again.

When I call their customer service, they said their warehouse weight the parcel is 3.5lb, they don’t need to provide it, they can charge you what ever they want.  Wow, I’m afraid next time they’ll charge my 1lb parcel  for 10lb price.  Last time, they also charge my parcel around $15 for correct address. I call them I didn’t request any corrections. They said their computer shows it is. No arguing.   You never know how much is the unknown charge until you’ve a bill. You can’t find any service fee on their website too. Their bill only shows how much you need to pay， no any details, such as the size of the box or weight. Moreover, even you’ve the recording, they’ll tell that your measurements is wrong.

Is this the first 100 pound box you ve ever delivered?  Seriously.  I demanded answers.  I was told the depot would contact me.  Surprise! No contact.

This is highly irresponsible behavior from Purolator not to train or instruct their employees well enough with their responsibilities and give some sort of resolution when a customer reaches out with some issue. My issue hasn't been resolved yet and I'm still unaware when I'll get my package. Very disappointed!Date of experience: May 27, 2021"

1214,Debjoy Chowdhury,"Pathetic Service!! Deserves -5 star!!I'm totally disappointed with Purolator service and will never recommend anyone to use your service. I had a package delivered by Purolator and that hasn't reached me yet. Last Friday(21st May), the shipment came to my place, but returned due to a missing entry code. I confirmed the address right away by calling a customer service agent(after waiting 30 min). He assured me the package will arrive Tuesday(25th May). It didn't arrive, rather online tracking updated as missing Apt/Unit number(HOW FUNNY!!). I was pissed off and chose the pickup option with the help of your chat bot. Later I realised it's not safe to go outside in the COVID situation. Then again I called the customer service to ask for an update. Now after waiting 35 minutes, she said the driver missed the apt number. I again confirmed my address, entry code and everything and told her to change it from pick up to delivery to my place. She updated and confirmed with me of the change. Today morning(26th May) I saw the address incorrect notification again in the online tracking. I called the customer service again and waited for more than 1 hour to get hold. She told me that there is an incorrect address and the package is going to the pick-up point. I laughed at that kind of pathetic service as none of my previous updates worked. I wonder if they don't encourage a second attempt to the same address. It would be nice for the customers if they had mentioned beforehand that they don't pay a visit to an address twice. Or they could have updated the online tracker to pick up once the 1st attempt missed. Anyways, seeing a lot of negative reviews, I'm pretty sure you don't care about the customer complaints and hence my complaint would go in vain. But as I wasted my money paying for their service, I don't want anyone else to waste their time and money after Purolator. They are just PATHETIC, PATHETIC, PATHETIC!!!!!Date of experience: May 26, 2021"
1215,Welby Thomas Keir,"Is it possible to give a minus star rating?I am starting up a home based business. My partner and I ordered a shipment from New Market. it was a sizeable order requiring 3 deliveries from Purolator. We received the first 2 deliveries with no problem on My 14th. The 3rd one is missing however. When we called Purolator they had told us to call the company we ordered from. I believe this is what they call passing the ""buck"". When I spoke to Customer service last night (may25th) after 40mins on hold. Janet (Purolator rep) told me she could see that there is confirmation by GPS that the package was dropped off on my porch. When I had ask for confirmation that it was the same GPS coordinates as the first 2 deliveries . Janet changed her tune and just kept confirming my address and not the GPS. She kept telling me i show your address as.... I then asked her to escalate the issue to someone else. She claimed that she would make a ticket for the driver to get back to me. This morning i received the call not from a driver but from another Customer rep named Sal who was very rude and said he will be closing the case as it showed by GPS my packages have arrived. I requested that the case remain open and have his Supervisor call me back. He insisted that they could email me back. Normally this wouldn't an issue but due to the amount my partner and i have spent on these items. I wanted to speak to a Supervisor. Sal was still being rude and during this time speaking over me. (Some crappy customer service).When I was relying the information over to my partner. Sal hung up. So I am calling back.Now as I my typing this I have been listing to their hold music for the last hour. Purolator if these are the type of people you have manning your inbound calls and claiming to be Customer Service. There needs to be some retraining done.Date of experience: May 26, 2021"

They don’t even bother to deliver the packages anymore, they just bring them to a pickup centre and then text me to go get my own packages. Ridiculous as EVERY other company delivers to my address no problem. Purolator drivers are simply ignorant lazy people I guess.

1217,Bishop,"Purolator service is the worstPurolator service is so bad, Amazon.ca has in my settings to not deliver via Purolator or I will cancel that order. They too are on my S**T list bc they sent a very important, time sensitive order, using Purolator.Purolator used to deliver right to my rural address. ALWAYS had trouble finding us even tho they would drive by every weekday. THEN, they dropped off my stuff 7 miles away, which was inconvenient. That place burned...there are other places tho. NOW they drop off a town away which is 1 Hr. 20 Min. round trip drive. There's the hassle of getting there, standing in line, all of that. Which means that not only is this totally unreasonable and horrible service, we have to include the time in that town just to get the package, which is a minimum 2 hour miserable experience. We are pissed. Service pretty much everywhere has become real crappy. They blame covid for everything and I have made calls to 'businesses' and in every case, the employees have been laughing and joking - and nobody can 'help' due to covid. This is pure BS and a problem which will be with us for years. I will never use Purolator again, unless desperate - in which case I will do without. BTW, their automated 'chat' specialist is too stupid for words. Never understands even the simplest question. I tried calling but after the automated response said THEY COULD NOT TAKE MY CALL - Purolator disconnected at their end. Maybe it's time to support local businesses instead of online shopping bc most online shopping, in my experience, has seriously dropped in quality. Because of Covid,...it's always Covid now.Date of experience: May 25, 2021"

I will NEVER use purolator again, and if a company is going to send me something through them, I will find someone else.  to be sure, this is the ONLY courier that can't seem to deliver packages, on time, or to the correct address.

Any buyers excitement that I had started to return, BUT...They attempted delivery to the wrong address.  They left a sticker (surprise surprise) that says they were there and I now have to drive 40km away to pick up my package, tomorrow.   furthermore, my neighbour was home and did not hear a door knock or doorbell, just saw some guy creeping in her yard before racing away.

1223,Darren Lowe,"I will never use this service againI will never use this service again, and I hope whoever reads this, and the other negative reviews, takes it to heart.  Like many, if I could give negative stars, I would.  Even 1 star is too generous for this soulless courier. I do a lot of courier/shipping.  I have confidence that most couriers will get the packages to their destinations on time, if not before.  When I am curious, I can log in to my account and see exactly where the package is.  None of that sounds unreasonable, especially in todays technological world.  Don't expect any of this with Purolator.  Their 'tracking' is inaccurate, and does not update properly with scans.  Often, the tracker will return a result of ""In Transit"" with no attached estimated delivery time even whilst it is out for delivery, only to be updated at the end of the day to ""Attempted Delivery"" or (currently) ATTENTION.  Now, late into the pandemic, things are even worse. Packages often do not arrive, and IF they do, it is well past the expected (and paid for) delivery date.  Their website and tracker is completely useless, with every package now inevitably stopped at a sorting facility likely very close to you, but hanging in limbo with an affixed tracking update of ""delayed due to the pandemic.""I am now convinced the customer service agents are using the exact website you are to track your package, as they have no answers at all, ever.  This might seem like a lofty claim, and I hope you never put it to the test, but the agent will read you word for word what you are already seeing on the website.  pressing for more, they robotically and presumably read from a script a series of dead responses, with the highest escalation being an investigation, the details of which, an ambiguous thing the customer service agent can't even outline.  The headache from using this company is by far the worst.Like many in the comments here, I have now called amazon and asked to delist purolator, and have decided to take a moral stand against them, and will no longer use their service, or accept any packages from them. If future clients/companies/distributors insist on using purolator, I will find different vendors.  Plain and simple.  This company should be shut down, and long ago.I am not a big review guy, and have had consistently horrible experiences with other companies before, and I have never written a review like this, ever.  But this company is so frustrating and poor that I feel the need to waste more of my time hopefully saving whoever reads this from using them.  Dont copy/paste your bs response Purolator, all it does is show how empty and truly uncaring your company really is.  instead, quit your jobs, find something better for yourselves, because I wish, hope and pray purolator goes bankrupt and crumbles forever away before this year is done.

I was literally 10 feet away from the door this morning when the delivery was made. I only noticed the sticker on the door when I let the dog out! Not happy with Purolator, there are much better services out there. Use them. Purolator is not recommended as you can see that they consistently receive a score of 1 in their reviews.Date of experience: May 11, 2021"

1263,John,"Please stop using Purolator as your delivery companyThis is the worse delivery company in North America. They do not fulfill their duties, do not attempt to deliver to the person's address, but rather always deliver it to a facility in the area, saying they attempted the delivery when that is not the case. They are not accountable for not delivering their packages. I was on a conference call with Amazon and Purolator and Purolator refused several times to transfer the call to their supervisor upon request and raised their voice to me. They provided conflicting information, which the Amazon representative corrected. My delivery was late (actually I have not received it yet). They said they attempted the delivery but they did not, and they did not leave a paper slip either which confirms it. We are under a stay at home order in my city and asking me to go pick it up at a facility is asking me to break COVID-19 public health measures, that state that non-essential activities are prohibited. I urge all businesses to please stop using Purolator as your shipping company.Date of experience: May 10, 2021"
1264,Vitaliy,"Incompetence at its fine, hats off to you guysThis has to be one of the most impressively awful Purolator incidents I have ever encountered and it goes beyond anything I have ever experienced before. I had ordered a mouse from a store that is about 4 kilometers from where I live, low and behold Purolator was chosen as my delivery service. Normally I would immediately cancel the package but by the time I had caught it they had already somehow shipped it. I thought to myself “Huh, maybe Purolator is finally making a turn-around, doing things like same-day shipping!” No dear reader, they did not make a turn-around. What ensued has been and still is an 8 DAY CHASE SCENE for one single package. So prepare yourself as this is a story that you’ll want to hear. Act I, “Missed Delivery”On the Monday the package was SUPPOSED to come in (as Purolator does not operate on the weekend and I ordered it on a Saturday) I had a bad feeling, there were no updates on the package tracker website for quite some time and there had already SOMEHOW been a missed connection. I rechecked my address and stuff like that just to make sure that there were no excuses that they could pull such as “not a valid address” or “unable to make a delivery” etc. All the sudden after hours of waiting an update sprung up that the package was in transit, overwhelmed with joy I awaited the delivery persons arrival by diligently staring at my computer screen for hours, searching for the slightest update, but the update never came, in fact nothing came neither the update nor the package. Instead, what I did for the rest of the night was wonder, wonder how beautifully incompetent someone has to be in order to miss a 6 foot tall board with the names of all of the tenants and contact numbers along with the keypad which is used to type the numbers and call them. I know! I’ll just restate what the customer service representative told me when I confronted them with the same question. “Our Agents don’t carry phones”Act II, “The Pickup Debacle”“Here we go” I said to myself as on the Tuesday I read that I had somehow managed to input an invalid address and thus the legendary phrase was uttered “Address Correction Required” thinking quickly and clearly I decided that a pickup would be the best use of both my time and Purolator's time so I had logically decided that a location CLOSEST to me which is listed as a pick up point on their website and was recommended by their amazingly incompetent robot was best. After waiting one day, on Wednesday, I had hopped on the bus and rode over to the pick-up point which, mind you, was about 15 kilometres from my home, but all of that is just details. Upon arriving there I had realized something intriguing, there was no Purolator office nor sign. I went into the closest shop and asked a nice lady where they think the Purolator pick-up point was and they had pointed me in the direction of a small corner store right beside them. Determined, I marched onwards and upon entering my soul had dropped out of my body. Not only was the corner store small, but there was no designated area for pick-ups, instead, upon asking the clerk they told me that this was, in fact, a drop off point.Act III “The Bungle”Promptly after I got denied by the store clerk I decided to call Purolator customer support and had sat in queue to reach a representative for over 25 minutes, I had given up so I signed up for their callback service and started on my trip back home. Not an entire 25 seconds after I had registered for callback, my phone started blowing up. On the phone a chipper representative whose mood quickly turned sour when I told him the address called me stupid in not so many words and had quickly let me know that he had submitted a hold request at a facility nearly twice the distance from the pickup point and nearly 10 times the distance from the store I had ordered from but again, that's just a small detail. And this story is only just beginning.Act IV “Missed Delivery, AGAIN????”Goddamn it Purolator, just when my trust issues started to go away with you guys you offer the same heartbreak as usual. Upon reaching home I knew I could relax as Purolator representatives were cautiously caressing my package and making sure it gets to the facility with the fastest, most efficient and safe way possible. Once I woke up from that daydream what I actually did when I got home was stress out because if Purolator tossed my package around and it broke I may as well have to deal with their service again. Over 24 hours from the time the hold request was made for my order some braniac over at their offices thought that Re-Delivery was what I wanted after 2 failed prior attempts. Suffice to say it didn’t go over too well. To leave off on some note, neither good nor bad my package is still in transit to their facility none of the representatives know where it is or when it’ll get there but oh well.Date of experience: May 10, 2021"

No slip was left at the door, and no delivery reattempt was made until 4 weeks later, when a slip mysteriously showed up at my door -- this time, I actually was home, however the delivery person did not knock, ring the bell, or call me.

They haven’t and I have no idea if I should just cancel and get my money back and try ordering again.

She quickly switched to that call, but the driver had  gone leaving an attempted delivery slip attached to the foyer door. The slip said the package would be available for pick up at 11:00 a.m. Monday morning at a specified local Michaels store. I called the store and asked if my Mom would have to be present for pickup, as she has been in no stores since Covid. I was told that the slip would enable me to pick up on her behalf. I went to the store at just before noon on Monday. No package ... The helpful staff did a thorough search, incl. out back.. Told me I would have to call Purolator . Tried to do that, and was on hold for a very long time, and eventually gave up and rechecked the online tracking which cryptically said there had been a sorting error. Apparently the package had gone to a wrong ( unspecified ) pick up location . :( And, much as we tried, we could not discover which one. The next morning, Tuesday, the online tracking said it was out for delivery...🤔 Did that mean to my Mom’s home ( which would have been the right thing to do.. ) or to Michaels ? Again, impossible to get through on the phone to clarify the cryptic online tracking ‘info’ ... Then the online tracking said it was at another location, but as I prepared to go there, my nephew saw that it was supposed to be at Michaels ... I went there and again presented the slip. Was asked for I.d. I ( slightly testily ) explained the circumstances as briefly as possible... and was given my mom’s package 🎉🙄 Our family is very underwhelmed by Purolator, as I hope you can understand.Date of experience: April 22, 2021"

These buffoons never even show up to deliver packages, and instead say that no one was home in order to reach a quota. Of course, when I reach out to Customer Support, they are of no help, and can't even tell me where my package is or when I will receive it. They just tell me it's ""On the way.""

I then had to use the washroom so I went back to my apartment for 10 min. I refreshed my computer before going back down and guess what. I missed the delivery. Ran down and tried to see if maybe he was still there. Gone 5 min before I got there. 180 lb package that they are now leaving in a convenience store. This is NOT SERVICE.

Not for anything, I think someone at purolator upper management should be looking at these, and remeber where they get there income from.

I called them again yesterday and was on hold for 45 minutes just to make sure they had the correct address which they do but the delivery driver is unable to find my address (Even though I get packages delivered here weekly in a suburban area). I asked them to leave the package at the receiving depot in my town yesterday so I could physically pick it up myself but they could not even organise that with the driver stating yet again that he could not find the address.

Great. 10:30pm rolls around and now the truck has had a mechanical delay. That was four days ago. Any request for an update is met with 'please check back with the tracking system'. No idea where it is, can't pick it up, because the support can't verify where it is. My package had to travel a whopping distance of 20km. I'm pretty sure it's lost, and if not, severely damaged.

Used their online service (Friday night) to update the info and took a screen shot of the confirmation.  Now it's Monday and the package still isn't out for delivery, claiming it still needs a buzzer code.

They received so many complaints about the exact thing I am complaining about in such a short amount of time, they dropped them.Now I know how this plays out.

Sorry, there is an actual difference between supposed to do it and actually doing it.I would strongly suggest that you do not use this company. Especially if you need a guaranteed delivery.

The Amazon rep said Purolator drivers don’t like delivering to apartments. Please understand I’m talking about a 2 story building with 8 apartments, no security and really easy access. I do a lot of online shopping and Purolator is the only delivery agent that is a problem. If there are too many complaints they will lose the Amazon account. I can hardly wait for that to happen.Date of experience: March 30, 2021"

1371,Ralph Barrie,"Your above noted claim is respectfully…Your above noted claim is respectfully declined as the guitar case was not boxed to protect it from being damaged.  Also, this shipment was shipped OSNR (shipper authorized no signature on delivery) which is at the shippers risk, a declination letter is to follow. In regards to the above, I have been involved in Quality Management for the past thirty years. Your decision to not accept this claim is deplorable and wrong. Having put my trust in your service was my first mistake, and will EVER happen again. I will also be sure to share my disgust in Purolator and it's whole customer service process to all that will listen.At no time, did anyone suggest that my shipment should be in a box as stated. In FACT, the guitar was in it's own case (box) designed to protect the inner working of the guitar inside. Having put another box around the case would not have protected the guitar any more. As you can plainly see, the case was damaged by your service and by your poor handling.The guitar is also damaged as a result of rough handling. Why would anyone insure a thousand dollar with your terms?As well, having to wait almost a month to have my claim even reviewed, is unacceptable and points to a poor customer satisfaction process, complete with no confirmation of said claim when it was started, and a total lack of accountability on Purolators behalf. Your decision not to honour this claim is baseless in my opinion and without merit. Your terms and conditions are hidden unless you read the fine print. Why does Purolator have so many claims that they cannot even respond until a month later?I am not sure if you are still ISO approved, but if you are, I will be making a complaint to the auditing body as well.I put my trust and confidence in you to get my guitar to its safe destination, without even an apology as to the damage you caused, i am now left with a damaged guitar that most likely has a bent guitar neck from being dropped, and a severely damaged guitar case that was designed to protect the guitar itself, as well.Thank you for the quality lesson on how not to serve the customer.Purolator please do not respond unless you want to make this right!Date of experience: March 25, 2021"

Paid seller for expeditied delivery, and has been waiting next to the door of my house since I received the SMS notice. No doorbell, no knocking, no package left on the porch, but a missed delivery SMS notice and a slip on my door an hour later. Tracking says receiver unavailable, but I really do not know how I can make myself more available. The only explaination to this is clearly that the driver did not bother to actually deliver the package since leaving a slip is much faster. Looked up the forum, this kind of issue has been prevalent for purolator for years. Then contacted customer service. They are largely unapologetic and kept restating the fact that delivery was attempted and no one was home, even after I told them about how I waited for my package. It is clear that they know themselves that the driver probably did not bother, but they cannot say it and the company has no intention to make up for the error to its customers. When I further complained to their representative, she  closed the chat on me. Horrible horrible!  I will avoid buying from sellers who use purolator, or sending packages through them in the future.I use a ring doorbell so I have full evidence of the driver not actually delivering the package, by the way. Even in the face of this, purolator is still shameless enough to offer no compensation whatsoever.

It is a complete SCAM and when I talk to the 24/7 chat bot, it does not even make changes I made for the address and pick up inside the system. It stays marked the same “correct address” then talking through chat to a rep, he says something completely different. It is a complete scam to pressure you in to make money, capitalist greed.

They left a slip saying they were there but didn't ring the doorbell.  I called and they wouldn't go back same day so we had to wait till Monday.  That is today and they did the same thing.  I know she was home and awake both times as I called her to let her know they would be there soon as I received notifications before actual delivery.  The second time she put up a note beside her buzzer number with her name on it in bold but they still didn't ring the doorbell.  I was told today by Nadine a manager they once again could not go back to deliver it same day. I have now arranged someone to drive her to pick it up at the Purolator depot.  Purolator is ripping people off by charging more for home delivery of items that don't take place.  If people have to do to the depot to pick up, it is the same as Canada post for twice the price.  Purolator should be ashamed of themselves, their poor work ethic, dishonesty and unaccountability.  I boycotted this company for about 25 years due to massive issues with them before.  I was hopeful things had changed but apparently not so I will not use them again in the future.  Ever.  There is nothing they can say or do to fix this.  I am awaiting on a refund right now for service I paid for but did not receive.  The most hilarious part is that Purolator is using Canada Post to send it via snail mail and it will take 4-6 weeks to arrive.  When paying with credit card they can't issue a refund to the same credit card.  I will be keeping all my phone recordings and documentation in case I don't get that refund.

What's really sad is that there is my name on the parcel and no attempt made at all to get in touch with me.  I'm in the phone book in white pages and am the only person with my name on facebook etc.  The number of times I order from Ebay and no phone call from perolator indicates that they don't value my business.

I still can't figure out how Purolator ends up with my parcels that were supposed to go to my mailing address which is registered on ebay under my account shipping address, and with amazon under my account shipping address.  With my long History of not getting my parcels I at least know why I'm not getting them, and no Purolator I don't have a cell phone, but I have an email address.

I called several times and a manager called me back was rude and then never called again. Found out a day later the driver knew it wasn't packaged properly but still took it. He says he spoke to the new guy which he did, but he's new and barely speaks English so he didn't really understand what he was being told.  Now Purolator driver's are driving over curbs and parking like fools when they come here.  There is zero accountability and they really don't care that they provide horrible service.  Both Chris and Tracy at the regina branch shouldn't hold management positions as they don't care about customer service and that's kinda their job!Date of experience: March 09, 2021"

I understand there are covid delays, but I contact customer support and they assure me it will be delivered the following day, so I take time off work and stay home all day waiting in Ann important delivery, I have had friends come to my house from 8am until I am off work to ensure someone is there to meet the driver. Over a MONTH this has been going on! I was told the driver couldn’t find the address, then I was told it was failed to be delivered because the driver didn’t have a buzzer code. I live in a house! No buzzer code required! And the address is correct, I have confirmed it repeatedly with purolator. I called customer service AGAIN yesterday and was ASSURED my package would be on the truck this morning, then I get an email from customer service today saying it’s been returned to sender.

1419,Tony N,"Not only failed to delivery, but disingenuous and disrespectfulI contacted customer support to indicate that package tracking showed it was delivered, although it was not was received. In my same-day response, I noted that I had checked my Nest Hello video and confirmed there was no activity. Three days later, I received a response, requesting the product information and a video copy. Of course, the video history was only five days, so it was no longer accessible. Purolator indicated they checked the route inspection and said the GPS shows the driver at my address. They asserted that they had confirmed delivery. Further, they noted that since the shipment indicated no signature required, I should contact the shipper. And, not unexpectedly, the vendor cannot help me because I ordered the package via Amazon. At this point, we have Purolator saying they ""confirm delivery"" and myself indicating that I had watched a video three times over for the entire day with no evidence of any attempted delivery. I requested a way to escalate my concern, at which time Purolator closed my send and sent me a customer satisfaction survey email.I called Purolator customer service, gave the case contact number, re-explained my issue, and asked to talk to a manager. After some back and forth in frustrating conversation, I asked to have the GPS tracking information. The manager read me the coordinates. I prompted entered this into Google and discovered that the location was almost half-a-kilometre east of my home. I challenged the manager that this did not constitute a ""confirmed delivery."" He suggested that the driver probably put the package on a trolley several packages to deliver to multiple houses. I was baffled as I had never seen any courier ever deliver in this manner in my suburban neighbourhood. After some back and forth dialogue in escalating frustration, he bluntly asked if I wanted anything else.  I asked for further escalation to an ombudsman, to which he provided the phone number for head-office. That phone number simply connects to an employee directory with no operator assistance.My claims and customer service complaints are listed as follows:Lack of timely request for the video. The email exchange with customer service could have requested the video right away.Burden of proof on the consumer. Both agents made me feel that the burden of proof was on me by continuing to throw back the request for a video. There was never any suggestion, hint or recognition that they bore any responsibility.Disingenuous regarding delivery confirmation. The customer exchange via email incorrectly indicated they had GPS proof of delivery to my exact address. This was a lie, untrue. Further, the manager escalation claim that the courier delivered it by foot 400m in the middle of February was blatantly a baseless tactic. No resident of my neighbour would claim to have ever witnessed this by any courier at any time.Lack of empathy and argumentative. My interaction with the manager showed him defensive and argumentative, lacking any compassion or remorse in any form.Disrespectful in requests for escalation. Requesting an escalation to have a case closed and asking for a further escalation but being directed to a generic company directory showed a complete disregard for concerns.Presently, Amazon has refunded the $10.97 for the cake pan, which Purolator had lost or failed to deliver. I am writing this because Purolator should not be allowed to get away with treating its customers in such a manner. This has nothing to do with the money but rather an acknowledgement that Purolator has shirked responsibility for not delivering its service. And acknowledging that it had been both disingenuous and disrespectful in its customer interactions.My claims are as follows:1. Purolator failed to deliver a package, despite marking it as delivered to my address;2. Purolator placed an undue burden of proof on the receiver and did not request key information in a timely manner;3. Purolator was disingenuous about the evidence that it has delivered the package, misrepresenting that their data indicated tracking to my exact address;4. Purolator has failed to implement best practices, such as attaching a photo to the delivery tracking, which has become commonplace during the pandemic; and,5. Purolator acted disrespectfully in not providing the consumer with an avenue for escalation by closing an email case prematurely and directing me to call a generic business directory.Date of experience: March 05, 2021"

Keep in mind as a self employed entrepreneur in a pandemic, work is very scarce and I can't effort to miss deadlines and lose contracts.My delivery was scheduled for tuesday morning. Around noon I get an email telling me my package couldnt be delivered because my street is closed. My street is NOT closed. I got a package from intelcom and from canada post the very same morning. But there is construction on the corner so I understand it might be a little confusing (even tho every other delivery service never missed a delievery). So I call and explain the situation. The person understood and put a note to the driver and even left my phone number if he's confused. She GUARANTEED my delievery would be there in the morning.Its kinda messing with my deadlines but its ok, I'll manage.Day 2 around noon I get an email saying the same thing. I call again, explain again my street is NOT closed. The person called dispatch and GUARANTEED the truck would come back around 3pm. 3pm...nothing.I call again (keep in mind its 45min on hold everytime you call). The person told me the driver is late and GUARANTEED he would be there before 6pm.6pm...nothing.I call again. Now they transfer me to a superior. Very nice lady, she understand that the driver is an idiot and have no respect for his job or the clients. She said I could pickup the package at distribution center. I drive 30min over there only to be told the package is in the truck and they cant give it to me. I call back the supervisor and she GUARANTEED the package would be there first thing in the morning. I even get an email saying the resolved the issue with the driver.This morning, I get an email at noon telling me the driver can't access my street...I call again, this time I speak with a super arrogant supervisor who tells me that my adress is not good and he can't do anything for me, that im not allowed to come pick it up and that I need to contact the sender and hangs up. I call the sender its a full voicemail. I can't do anything.Later the same lady as the day before calls me and tell me that the other supervisor was basicly telling bullsht to get rid of me and that I needed to come pickup my package at the distribution center before the curfew at 8pm.So drove another hour to pick up my package.I spent more than 4.5hrs waiting on the phone, had to drive for 2hrs, ended up losing a contract because I couldn't meet the deadline...and I couldn't get a refund for my shipping.Do yourself a favor and never ever deal with Purolator.Date of experience: February 25, 2021"

1450,Sam,"delivering a slip instead of the packageIt seems Purolator (Nepean, Ottawa) is just delivering slips saying they missed you and asking customers to go to a brunch far away to pick the package up. I have been working from home all day long and cannot miss anyone knocking the door or ring the bell. I spent 50 minutes calling the customer service and they arranged a re-delivery but another slip of paper was secretly delivered to the door. Unfortunately, I do not have a camera that records how they deliver the slip instead of the package.

For some reason, Purolator is the only one to consistently have problems delivering. Usually it goes to one of my neighbors (there are 5 houses on my street, next to the highway) and I have to watch until Purolator tracking says 'delivered', then I go around the houses looking for it. Today was different - the delivery was 'Out for Delivery' yesterday, but was 'Delayed in transit due to disruption'. Today it was out for delivery again, but this time they dumped it at some pickup counter in another town, and I will have to go and get it within 5 days.

I received that information on their chat line with a live person - after going through a bunch of garbage to get to a human being.So - they dropped my package off at a pickup location.

Tammy was a game changer from the get go.  The moment I spoke with her I felt relief but cautious at the same time because I was constantly being misinform by Purolator staffs.  Notwithstanding, Tammy took the time to listen and showed empathy throughout our entire conversation. She looked at her system then asked me a few questions to which she paragraph my answers to ascertained the information.  She told me that the depo was close due to Family day in Canada but she will send an email to the depo and follow up with me as soon as she receive a respond from them and guarantee that I will receive my package on Wednesday, February 17, 2021.   On Tuesday, February 16, 2021, I emailed James, social mediate coordinator who replied that Tammy was working on it.  About 12:01pm that same day I missed a call from Tammy, she left a detail message on my voicemail, after listening I immediately returned her call.  Once again she showed compassion and assured me that I will receive the package on Wednesday then verified my personal details for the driver to have.  On Wednesday, February 17, 2021, I received a telephone called from Purolator driver stating that he was here, I immediately rushed downstairs to get my package, the driver told me you don't need to rush we exchange a few conversations, he was very polite.   I just want to thank Tammy for being so compassionate, for showing empathy, being transparent and efficient.  Thank you for going above and beyond.

Currently this is the 10th day of Feb and I see an item has been sitting at the Fort St. John Depo since Feb 5 with no phone call to let me know item has arrived, they only keep items 5 days then send them back.  I think it would be common courtesy to let the customer know when their order is in.  Well today Feb 11 I went in to pick up my parcel and turned out there were 2 sitting there about to be sent back with no phone call given to me for either.  This is not performance. Tracking detailsPitney Bowes Tracking ID: PBXSA008156385, with phone number clearly visible by my address, 2nd item Purolator pin: 332713943055, also clearly shows my phone number just to the right and below my address.  I don't own a cell phone but do have an email address and a land line.  In follow up with them their reasoning was that only 2 digits of phone number were available to their employees, however my full phone number is clearly visible on both.  It makes sense that when items are shipped to a shipping address that would be the shipping address to be used.  Therefore before a shipping company takes on parcels from USPS they would ensure that all of a phone number is visible before they would take on the responsibility of handling the package and that they don't cover up vital delivery info like phone numbers with their own label before ensuring that info is on their label, better yet, let Canada post deliver it since that is Canada's equivalent to USPS.Date of experience: February 10, 2021"

1500,Ashlyn Eggum,"Be prepared to go on a quest to get your packages.Every apartment building has a mail room ro recieve packages when people aren't home. Almost always this mail room requires asking the front desk for access. Over the last several shipments I've ordered that were shipped through purolator (not by my choice) this is just way too difficult for their drivers to figure out. After pulling up in front of the building, looking at the doors and immediately giving up, they send my package to the absolute farthest away location for me to pick it up. There is a purolator store not 15 minutes walk from my building, but I have to bus for an hour and a half one-way to pick up my packages. Every. Freaking. Time. This is the laziest, most disorganized, crappy shipping company out there. That they haven't failed and gone bankrupt is truely astounding.

Yes my item is very large TV, but there should be something setup that if a shipping company is behind or cannot handle large shipment, that the system would jump to one of the other competitors.

As you can see from other folks' reviews, this delay is likely to be significantly longer. No other carrier has imposed these sorts of delays on  any shipment of mine, particularly in-province, even during the peak of pandemic situation. The typical response of 'we are prioritizing medical and express deliveries' will be given, with only the offer to open a trace if it exceeds.

Moving from Europe here lately, a Co like this would never exist back home or be allowed to treat customers this way.

I ordered some delicate Christmas snow village items from a shop in Ontario. I am in Manitoba. I watched the tracking of my package. Picked up on January 7th. Went to two different sort facilities in Ontario the same day. Now in transit to Manitoba. I was thinking YAY this is going to come quickly. NOT!!  January 12th arrives in Manitoba. So I wait and wait and wait some more for an update. Finally the 18th (six days later) I do the chat with a rep..oh not sure why it hasn't been updated. Wait another two days and then finally see its scheduled for delivery the next day. Next day comes...I get notification its on the truck and on the way to me. Few hours later I get another notification saying address is not in delivery service area. I am rural about 40 minutes from city. What? So call them, nope don't deliver to me. I said okay drop it at my daughters (in the city) Ask for her postal code...nope not there either. Pardon me?? I ask ok where is nearest pick up point for me then? Then I am told a town that is about 1/2 hr from me (which is fine) I did say soooo you are going to come from the city and go right past me to get to that other town. I said you do realize that town is farther from the city than I am? Oh really?  So fine. Thats the package destination. I wait and wait a few more days. Chat again on January 25th...whats the hold up? It was on a truck before, now where is it. Not sure I am told. OMG...put it somewhere and I will pick it up myself from the city facility. Ok but that won't be available today! Ok tomorrow then?? Tracing specialist (ya ok) will call you, I will let them know you will pick up. Two more days go by, hear nothing! This morning get a notification that it is on the truck for delivery. Ummm delivery to where??? To me...to the other little town, to the facility in the city?? Again get on the chat to see where it is going. Last entry was for the little town....ok then. Finally makes it there, and I drove 1/2 hr to pick up. Its sad really because I plan on ordering from that shop in Ontario alot, they lost a potential repeat customer. I will not deal with them again.

Might as well put 2-3 years and hope you forget! It has been WEEKS for multiple packages and nothing. I call them and all they tell me is to wait another 2-3 days. They also say they won't check on the item because they ""can't"". I have still not received my items, these items together are worth about $2000.

I planned to spend the weekend reading and studying, getting assignments done, but it has been 2 days of checking and calling and still nothing. I am behind on important work and my $500+ package is at some random persons house. How hard is it to get a driver to pick it up and bring it to the right address?

I have had zero deliveries from Purolator that have actually made it to me on time or at all.One has to wonder what kind of joke management runs this outfit but then I am reminded its Canada Post that owns them.  Time to pressure the seller to give me a refund or put heat on Purolator to find my expensive package.  What a bloody crap-show Purolator isDate of experience: January 05, 2021"
1613,Torontoeh,"Driver is a liar and I lost out because of it!Not only did the driver not deliver the package to my door Dec 18 as indicated by them, they went about dropping it at Penguin Pick Up where it sat for 5 days. Then they returned the package to Dell.  I had no idea any of this happened until it was too late and my laptop was returned. My security camera proves that the driver did not come to my house, where I was home anyway, and simply lied!  And even if the liar had come to my house, he left no notice that the package was dropped at Penguin. So he is just a dumb liar. When I called customer service, they told me it was partially my fault because I should have been watching out for the package with tracking it.  Aside from the fact that the Dell website said delivery is not expected until Jan 6th, it is incredibly rude for the service person to tell me this is partially my fault because I wasn't tracking and watching. Trust me not everybody is tracking their packages online, and not everybody knows a package is even coming to them!  So Dumb!So the driver is a liar and the service agent is just rude. Problem is I have already stopped using Purolator because they suck so bad compared to FedEx that I am left with no recourse other than to write this review!Date of experience: January 04, 2021"

1619,Great Kahuna,"I have a very unique one hereI have a very unique one here: Couple of days ago I phoned the purolator facility in London, ON. They physically confirming they had my tracked item since Wednesday 23rd Dec, they noticed like 6 delays and on holds since without any attempt of delivery.Then I phoned/chatted Amazon same hour, and they've emailed Purolator to prioritise shipping. Today, somehow the tracking webpage on purolator shows an attempt has been made and a notice was left at my address. I was at home all day and I live in a residence that has intercom system and mailboxes and never had any problem in receiving Amazon or other couriers.I phoned the facility locally in London, they said they have no way of contacting the driver who has the item (25KG item). I told them no notice can be find at all at my address. They advised me to call customer service team who would be able to contact the driver for a re-attempted delivery today.I phoned customer services (25-minutes waiting time, listening to the hold-on music which Shazam failed repeatedly to recognise). I then managed to speak to a very interesting Purolator representative, who told me that the facility staff do not know what they are doing and it's forbidden to contact the driver and he would never arrange such contact unless it's life-threatening like a bone marrow transplant sample !!!! he said he only goes by the book and his phone calls are recorded and seems quite confident, over-confident shall we say.I took his name, but refused to take his ID when he dared to give it to me, also refused his offering to file a complaint on my behalf about his own company!!The representative has a unique ability of regurgitating terms and conditions in an attempt to circumvent the simplest of answers you'd hope to hear, in addition to a discouraging ability whilst disturbing your thoughts and distracting you at ease with any irrelevant information.I simply had to finish the call politely, I could not understand why a migraine was suddenly building up in my head listening to the representative. I basically wanted my item delivered, that is all - I did not want to complain.Anyhow, I phoned the facility and told them about my interesting encounter with this gifted representative. They were shocked, furious and upset and kept apologising to me about something they have not done themselves. Yet, the problem is not solved, and it's likely that a driver is going around in town with my item, if allegedly attempted to deliver as the website says. At the end of the day, no delivery notice left and no evidence to support their claims.Purolator: please stop insulting our intelligence us customers, and consider respecting your staff and the business you are supposed to honor and perform to the best of your human abilities. Also, train your staff not to complain and badly critique their colleagues, it's hard nowadays to hold a job so the priorities for your staff are:be nice, kind and polite.Thanks.Date of experience: January 02, 2021"

1621,Marla,"My Amazon packageMy Amazon package, which was a Christmas gift, was ordered on Dec 13 and due to arrive on the 21st. Not only did it not arrive, but I had to spend hours on Perolator very bad customer service line to try to track it (it was last recorded being out for delivery on Dec 15 and then nothing - and the website wasn't updated). I finally convinced someone from customer service to put a tracer on the order after Christmas and then it was next registered to have arrived at a Mississauga warehouse on Dec 31. I spoke again to customer service (twice) on Jan 2 to see if they can tell me when the package would be delivered and they said, that no, they couldn't tell me. It may be delivered the week of the 4th. They don't deliver over the weekend(!!!) and they didn't deliver on Monday, Dec 28(!!!) and this is a busy time so it all depends on when they might have a truck ready. ARE YOU JOKING ME????

1624,Nikki Chursky,"WORST COMPANY OF ALL TIMESoooooooo I have a history with Purolator. My husband’s Uncle works for them and he knows the absolute Moron who is assigned to our route. He began this history of hell when he wouldn’t deliver a package because my dog ...a senior lab who is beloved by—literally—EVERYONE who comes to our door to deliver, and who barks a little out of excitement (and also...duty!! Hello that’s his job) when someone comes to the door—anyhow when my dog barked at him from (get this) INSIDE the house. Good grief—the terror!! He put a note on my package that the dog was barking and I had to pick up my package. Obviously I called and complained. This did nothing but tick him off and the vindictive jerk will NOT deliver to our house on the premise that my dog (who can barely get up by the way) is vicious. I found out from my Uncle in law that Purolator drivers don’t have to drop off at the house if they use this excuse, but still get paid for the delivery just the same, so this guy is just skipping every house he can and dropping them off at the depot. Here’s me—pregnant with a toddler in a snowstorm having to go downtown (a town with hardly any available parking in front of the depot forcing me to walk far and carry heavy packages far distances) during Covid—a time when I am ordering mostly online to protect myself and my unborn child —and don’t even get me started with how incredibly rude the women at the depot is. Whole other issue as they absolutely refuse to try and make things in any way easy —they get mad if I drop in to see if there are any packages for me when I happen to be downtown—God FORBID I try to be proactive and cut into their standing around with having to check for me. Back to my issue at hand—complaints don’t work with this company, there is “nothing they can do” —I’ve even got a hold of the head office. We thought we reached a solution which was to always be leaving my poor dog inside. I’ve left my dog inside on nice days when he could have been out—he still won’t deliver and finds ridiculous reasons—like he “can’t get up our hill because of snow” we have three access points to our house, one of them is a straight drive into the driveway, no hill required. The tip of the iceberg for me was when I called head office and they asked if my neighbour had a dog. I almost lost my mind...like seriously? So even my neighbour can’t have a dog? By the way, she is also 12 and can barely walk and is a total sweetheart. Dude...if you have this many problems with dogs it’s one of two things: either you are an absolute lying jerk (my guess) or you are some sort of creepy pedophile and dogs are picking up on it.. And thanks to you Purolator for giving absolutely zero cares about people’s convenience or the reason they order things online for convenience in the first place. They are the absolute WORST COMPANY EVER and I urge every business not to order from them with hopes they go under. Sorry for my Uncle in law and everyone else but hey—I’m sure Amazon is hiringDate of experience: January 01, 2021"

I contacted amazon and they told me that I can contact Purolator and ask them to stop my package from arriving. On my first call, the person told me they can't stop the package from coming yet because it is not in the same province yet. I am in BC and the package was in Ontario at the time. Called again just now to check if they can cancel it, and now the person told me they can't cancel the package until it gets on the truck on the day of the delivery. Why are they saying different things? They told me that I can refuse the package when it gets to my house but these guys never knock. They always just leave the package at my door. When I saw that the majority of the review for Purolator were negative, it explained a lot about them.

I live in an apartment, When they came (and left), they said there was a problem-they couldn't get in the building. Well duh, its locked! They didn't try the buzzer number, just left. When I called the customer service, they said there wasn't a door code so that's probably why. I told her(and also left a notice for them to use the door code on the Amazon site), to use 118 to get in(my apartment number). I don't know why a courier/mail service wouldn't know to try that when delivering packages??I told the customer service lady that they could even just phone me and I would come answer the door in case they couldn't figure out how to do the buzzer. Two times and they failed both times. And yes the buzzer works fine. I tried it and so did my manager. You can push 118, #118,*118,118*,or 118#. As long as the number ""118"" is pushed, it works!      When I was in the lobby trying to check for a note, or to see if my buzzer was an issue, my manager(and a couple from upstairs) were there. They all remarked at how horrible the service is from Purolator.   Neither time did Purolator leave a note. I tried after the second attempt to pick up my package in person, but due to Christmas, I spent over half an hour on the phone and gave up.I am heading to a closer Purolator center to arrange to have my package delivered there, where I will pick it up in person.Date of experience: December 31, 2020"

1657,Sam,"Hands down worst delivery serviceHands down worst delivery service. They were to drop of a larger item to my apt building and the expected date of delivery was Dec 17th. They did not even make an attempt to deliver the package (item is a couch from Wayfair) once .... Instead just left it at a pick-up center. I called and spoke to one of their agents who said she didn't understand why they didn't make an attempt to deliver but told me my package would arrive on the 21st/22nd Dec. It did not arrive on the 21st,  I called again to inquire if it would be delivered the following day as I didn't want to lose another day waiting at home. The rep said that yes it would be dropped of on the 22nd, which as you can guess it was not. I called again on the 24th only to be told this time that the earliest I would receive it would be the 29th of Dec but more than likely it would be sometime after that... 12 days after the expected arrival date and still not even one attempt to deliver. I have now made other arrangements at personal financial cost to myself to retrieve my package. I would rate lower if I could, only saving grace was that their reps were polite on the phone.Date of experience: December 24, 2020"

We could have gone with Canada Post (remarkably, we still had time) but wanted to be ""sure"" Christmas would arrive for him, and were comforted by the clerk's words, ""It should be there by Saturday.""  Perhaps we should have asked which Saturday.   It's December 24, a week later, and Purolator has no idea where the package is.  I know there are those whose Christmases will be much more difficult than ours.  And Thomas is in the care of much loved family in Nova Scotia.

The customer service person told me that it's because my package is and I quote ""Heavy and Oversized"".

My neighbour received my package we have very similar addresses i reported this when i called yet they dismissed their mistake and said it was delivered correctly to the right address.

I replied to the email stating I found the package in my mail box which isn't close to my house and which I can't see from my front door. I suggested that it would have been helpful if the tracking message would have stated the package was left in Mail Box, This would have saved time and aggravation. Don't know how the GPS works I suspect if it shows the driver is on your street and went to your house. I don't enjoy filing these comments and didn't 2 years ago when a BBQ was left at the business up the street.

So dont even bother reaching out on the phone, chat, twitter, or whatever email the rep posts under this review. Ether you get your items (ya right) or you dont. May the odds be in your favor. Here is my current situation:I was supposed to have a bed frame delivered, I missed the first attempt on Nov 23rd (was in a meeting and phone was on silent, so my fault no worries). The next day it was on the truck for delivery, I waited for it and at 5:40pm they said it was too heavy and didnt bother to even try to drop it off. I was home all day and could have done it myself. The information on the tracking said to call and schedule a delivery date. I called in and confirmed a delivery date of Nov 26 and took the day off work to accommodate. When I checked the status on Thursday Nov 26 it hadn't moved since Wednesday morning, I again called and the CSR said they lost it and it wont be delivered. How they were able to lose what they claim is a large and heavy item is beyond me.They somehow found it on Friday and it was on the truck for delivery when seconds later they said there was no buzzer and it wont be delivered. Weird as the first driver was able to call my buzzer. Once again I called the CSR and she promised me it would go out and she put a request in to have it delivered. If you guessed that it wasn't delivered on Friday (the 27th) you are correct.

Once again, I ordered a product on the web and had no choice but to get it delivered by Purolator. Their website stated that I was supposed to get my product delivered today. Then, the website said Purolator randomly sent my product back to its original sorting facility (Toronto) and stated that it will only be delivered in 4-7 days from now. Called the customer service and they read back the website to me. No explanation for the incompetence, just that my product bounced back between Montreal and Toronto sorting facilities for no good/apparent reason. I deal all the time with FedEx and never hear such excuses: they just deliver things on time and as promised. HERE IT IS FOLKS: you can see from the number of negative reviews below (and copy/pasted “I’m sorry to hear …” responses from customer service) that Purolator view us all as “chumps”.

We all have a contract with the companies that sell us a product, and Purolator voids that contract when it fails to provide the product according to the terms of the contract. Let's end this charade once and for all!Date of experience: November 28, 2020"
1822,matt abai,"Worse customer service ever.Worse customer service ever.It's the same thing everytime I order something from Amazon. When I order a package it says it will be delivered by puralator, I wait for the package the whole day and then I get a email from amazon saying ""puralator tried To deliver your package"". My eyes have been glued to my camera all day waiting for the package and I get no phonecall or text saying that the package is outside. There's no paper outside saying that there was a delivery attempt. It's like they don't even leave their truck and they just scan the package saying there was an attempted delivery so they can be home by 4:30. I don't even know why Amazon is using such a crappy company to deliver their packages.I've been waiting for my package for the whole day. The website said at 8am that my package was on the vehicle, I waited the whole day and at 6pm it tells me ""Delayed due to current pandemic disruption""? It was in the vehicle? How does the pandemic have to do with that? Does the driver have the virus? It doesn't even specify.Date of experience: November 28, 2020"

I talked to customer service again because tracking shows it hasn't been shipped. Now I'm being told it will ship Thursday(tomorrow)...This is absurd and unacceptable.

It was rescheduled for Nov 20 and the driver ran out of time again.  Today Nov 23 it was still not delivered.  Today I spoke to a Service Rep and found out that new parcels take priority over parcels that Purolator missed the delivery date.  So therefore my parcel is no longer important and if the driver keeps running out of time I might never get my parcel.  Makes no sense to me.  You would think that if they missed the delivery date they would delivery it the next morning to make clients happy.

Sunday morning, I receive the same notice of delivery. I watched the Purolator truck pull into my lot, do a U-Turn and leave without trying to make the delivery. Moments later I got another failed delivery notice. No delivery attempt was even made, and they did not stick with the arrangements made directly with customer support! Can't believe I paid for this service. You are better off driving yourself to pick up the item yourself, and you will probably spend less on gas anyways.

Also, why was the package delivered when we already opted to pick it up. Now the note says pick up on Monday, 11/23!!! This is crazy!!!

So, he decided to leave our package inside WITHOUT giving us notice of his arrival. This was on November 11th, 2020. More than 30 minutes later I realized the package was delivered but nowhere to be found. I've opened a ticket with their support and they want to put the blame on the shipper, ignoring the fact of that delivery driver. Very displeased. If you guys continue this way, I hope businesses will stop using you guys. Change up your ways. For each time a Delivery Driver of yours drop by without announcing his arrival, I will lower a star.

Called back, on hold for 2 hours before I gave up.Go to their website and try to use “virtual assistant” which is a garbage AI that is so poorly programmed it can’t help with anything. It tells me it will connect me to a live chat agent - I wait for 30 mins and nothing.

Huh?Why was it shipped back to sender when I was told to pick it up at this location? The poor kid behind the counter didn't know, so I called Customer Service... they tell me, ""yup - it was shipped back to sender"" but couldn't give me any more information other than the exact same information I could get from the website using the tracking number. What is the point of support if they can't help beyond the tracking number information?This parcel was a warranty replacement for my heater. It's winter here and now I've got to wait for 1 week for the package to get shipped back and then HOPEFULLY the manufacturer (Dyson) will reship my package because as far as they are concerned ""Delivery was not accepted"" which is all the tracking number says, not to mention is untrue!

I will be using FedEx from now on.Edit: Funny how I am told in a response to this something COMPLETELY different then what the very unfriendly customer service rep told me on the phone this morning; according to her, I was lying about my delivery being listed as “Missed connection” as my order label was only created today and to be shipped today. Last night I spoke with a rep over Facebook messenger which went just as poorly.This company needs to get on the same page ASAP. As someone who works in customer service, you get a lot further with a customer if you show some empathy and compassion instead of complete annoyance.Today I changed my courier company with the medical supply company to use FedEx.

Why are area outside your truck route are being deprived of civic delivery when ASR designated parcel are being shipped?

I was emailed that the parcel was getting ready to be shipped and NOT that it had been delivered. By the time I was curious if it had actually shipped, it had been three days since it was delivered. The tracking notes say that it was delivered to the mail room. The mail room at that address is an open space with zero security, open to anyone who walks through the lobby. The building office was not open at the time and the fact that there are no signatures in the delivery document support the fact that the courier just left the box in the middle of a high traffic area without notifying anyone. The recipients apartment number was listed as was his mobile number. As he is disabled, the recipient finds it difficult to leave his apartment and is home mostly every day. Had the courier knocked on his door or called him, the recipient would've been able to receive the parcel. I have spent a lot of money for this item, a massager for my friend with crippling nerve pain, and I believe the appropriate measures were not used in order for my item to reach the recipient.Furthermore, I called customer service who opened an investigation. After several attempts to receive an update, they forwarded me an email they received two weeks ago stating that the investigation was closed because the parcel had been delivered at the right address. That was never in question. I wanted to know why I or the recipient was never informed about the delivery. Absolute ridiculous. Waste of time and money.

So much for communication.  I insisted that she should find the location of the truck so I can be aware of a estimate time of delivery but she goes on to tell me that no one knows their location.   What a bunch of crap So sick and tired of this company.  Never having anything shipped from them again.Date of experience: October 29, 2020"

Why put delivery instructions if not given...then got email this morning at 8:23 am saying package attempted to be delivered look for note to be picked up. Never received a call stating they were here... these people are very lazy and just do not want to deliver to the door in an apartment.

1924,Lynie Awywen,"Absolutely horrible customer serviceAbsolutely horrible customer service. I waited all day for a package and the driver did not attempt delivery, as I was excitedly waiting for my package and tracking it all day . COVID 19 has been such a stressor on everyone and these little moments of joy were additionally killed by Purolator, who had the power to be a catalyst for simple moments of joy - such as receiving a long awaited gift. Purolator also claimed they delivered it to my front door after their ""investigation"", which was a complete lie because my house cameras did not detect any motion at the time stated. Customer service continues to put a ridiculous amount of onus on customers (who really just want our package and not all of this additional stress) and none on your irresponsible drivers. GPS confirming location does not mean the package was delivered to the correct house, just the correct area so please stop using this ridiculous ""finding"" in your sloppy investigations. Hold your drivers accountable, they are not doing their jobs with integrity or due diligence.  I wish I could give this horrible company and its incompetent drivers less than a 1 because this is not the first time this has occurred to me and friends/family.Date of experience: October 29, 2020"

They delivered a special item to me just 36 hours after me ordering it, this has been weeks faster than any other shipper.  I am highly impressed, I recognize that a lot of negative reviews may come from the fact that people want to express their experience to warn others, however consider that there are cases where Purolator does an outstanding job and I'm still in shock that this item came THIS quickly and in perfect condition.Thank you and know that I will write a solid review if it's warranted, which for the service it absolutely was this time.Date of experience: October 28, 2020"

Today I checked the tracking number wondering why the laptop did not arrive. The tracking history shows that Purolator has been driving around my city for a week and a half with the laptop in their truck. They have allegedly made two ""delivery attempts"" however we are open 9-5 and our receptionist was not aware of any attempts. I called customer service to see what is going on and after 2+ hours waiting for an employee I gave up and hung up as I had other things to do.Not only is this terrible customer service but it is an absolute disregard for the environment - ""Let's have our trucks drive around town carrying packages that we won't actually deliver.""I have no idea how this company has managed to stay in business but they should be boycotted immediately.EDIT - Updated to mention that Purolator's generic copy paste response of ""send us your tracking number"" to its thousands of 1 star reviews is a perfect sample of how careless the organization is. Instead of assigning someone to respond to these, I recommend fixing your severely broken operations or better yet begin the wind up of your goat rodeo delivery company.Date of experience: October 27, 2020"

My first 2 orders were so successful because they were delivered by Canada post, an exceptional company and they deliver to my community mailbox. My 3rd order not so successful and you can guess why, if you can't then ill give you the answer...Purolator. I've been tracking and it says it was on the delivery truck in Mississauga and then another update of ""attempted delivery - receiver unavailable"" yet it was posted in Mississauga when the delivery address was in Brampton. OF COURSE the receiver was not available, YOU guys aren't even in the right city you dumbnuts. My parents are both retired so they are home all day so even if they were in the right City, my father says there was no knock/ring and there was no notice either. Now my package says its scanned as a pick up and will be held for 5 days. I have it delivered to my father's address because he visits me every 2 weeks and drops off mail and other things because I do not drive. I am also in a different City than him.  Now they are telling me to pick it up in Mississauga which is even farther away from me. DELIVERY MEANS TO MY DAMN EFFING DOOR OR MAIL BOX. I'm giving it 2 stars because I did contact customer service and was ""helped"" by Richard Y who said he had asked them to redeliver it. He then gave me a reference number and I asked what am I supposed to do with this? He said nothing, it just proves we helped you. A reference number isn't going to have my package delivered faster, if it even gets redelivered at all.

1932,Eric Oh,"Their tracking is blatantly inaccurate and missing detailsPurolator is horrible not because of any overt maliciousness or scheming but because the infrastructure they've set up for their service is so, so, so horrible. I've signed up for tracking notifications for my shipment over 5 times and still did not receive an email that my shipment was ""refused"". When I check my tracking number, the details on their website don't explain where the delivery was attempted for pickup, or where it is being held - asking their ""virtual assistant"" doesn't give you any information beyond that either. When I call their customer service, it's obvious that the information they have access to is not any better or different than the information I can get by going on their website. The times when it does give me information, it's not even accurate - I went to a pickup location after receiving a notification that it was delivered, and after seeing on the site that it was ready for pickup, and it just wasn't there. Why is it so difficult to have a little amendment saying ""your package was attempted to be delivered to here, and it was refused for this reason""? If it were up to me, nobody would ever use Purolator for delivering anything, but unfortunately I, and other shoppers, have to deal with the unfortunate nonsense of a company that only has one foot in making any effort to modernize its processes.Date of experience: October 26, 2020"

1934,Dianna Chin,"Amazon needs to stop using PurolatorAmazon needs to stop using Purolator or change their agreement.  Apparently if after the first attempt for ground shipment is not received, they do not want to guarantee or take responsibility of the delivery. They will not compensate for their confusion, timing issues or their staff's lack of care or attention.I had paid extra to get a television to be shipped for  a Grand Opening.  Made arrangements to have staff and rented a truck to deliver the television from head office to a site location. The first delivery attempt was day earlier than expected but it was not delivered properly because the driver or person trying to deliver did not want to listen to additional instructions to find the correct entrance. Called driver to come back but they left the area and she said she going to attempt a second time the next day.  They did not come as expected. As it was late, we had to call Purolator to re-direct the package to a new location. The driver came back on 3rd day to the original location even though it was requested to be re-directed. We advised that it was re-directed but the same driver claimed again that they could not find the entrance of the first location and left again even though they acknowledged the side street and hung up abruptly.  We tried to outside to find the Purolator rep and truck but both were not visible.One Purolator regional manager tried to ensure the package was redirected to the new location and expedite the shipment but the instructions were ignored.  The delivery was delivered after 6:30 pm on the day that it was expected as if there was no faster shipping request.Called back and asked Amazon to do a conference call to request compensation for not just the Amazon fast tracking fee but also extra staffing hours and truck rental charges.  Purolator advised they do not take any responsibilities nor compensate because it was not the first delivery attempt.Date of experience: October 25, 2020"

Prior to this, tracking shows they are unable to deliver because the mattress is heavy. They made it appear that they don't have a buzzer code as an excuse. Called their customer service 3 times and gave the code and my phone number. Latest update shows that they cannot deliver and they will contact me for appointment. They never called!

1938,Adam West,"Purolator Part 2: The SilenceI would say that I'm extremely disappointed with the service or lack thereof with regard to tracking, the non delivery and inaccessibility of my package but that wouldn't be entirely true. This is just a typical Purolator experience. Just like in the first installment, Poor Customer Service, Miscommunication and their sibling No Communication reprise their starring roles.When I ordered it last week, the delivery date said Monday. That was then changed to Tuesday, then Wednesday once Tuesday came. Since then, no updates. I was supposed to be reached out to by one of the tracing specialists, no response. This was meant to be a gift.I can only hope it arrives before the person's next birthday at this point. I asked whether I can pick it up, met with a no. When I asked why, this vague non answer about my package not being eligible for pick up was fed to me. However if it's not being delivered, the least you could do is tell me where it is, why it's delayed and how soon I can expect it. I've paid my own money for what's in the box and I'd like to know what you have done with my money. If you can't fulfill the delivery, say so, so that I can pick it up and deliver it to my house myself. If my package is lost, which clearly it is since it's not been scanned for most of the week, then just say so. This has been an all round poor experience but we knew that it would be going in and my complaints unfortunately are ALL too familiar. This whole operation is a scam and I genuinely wish them no future success. Maybe once they fold, online stores will be forced to use better services. I also know this is a pipe dream. Useless customer service, useless tracking, a tracing specialist who doesn't know how to send an email and drivers who lie about attempted deliveries. If I was this inept, disaffected, unskilled, unconcerned and completely out of touch with the needs of my clients in my job, people would die. Some of us don't get excuses at work. No matter how hard it is, we have to get it done. All we're asking these employees to do is ring a doorbell, send an email and update a tracker online. Have some pride in your work and make an effort. Stealing a living cannot be fulfilling. Never using this service ever again.

Thankfully, there was no tiny items (as i intended at first to buy an SD card too) that would have fell off with how big the gap was because of it being crushed.It's not the first time i have a below average experience with purolator, compared to other services like Amazon, UPS, Canada Post, but this one was particularly awful.The only plus side is that it arrived quickly but I'm sure it is mostly thanks to the company I ordered from.Date of experience: October 22, 2020"

1949,John,"Delivery *NOT* attempted more like...I would rather slap my grandmother than deal with Purolator, and I love my grandmother. I ordered a large, expensive, and heavy item. If you've read other reviews, you may guess where this is going - and you don't need more than one guess. My Amazon address has my ring number in it, because I'm not a monster and I like to get my stuff. The following courier companies have had no issue delivering things to me: UPS, FeDex, Intelcomm, Joeyco (some new crowd-sourced thing out of Toronto). They use the ringer, I let them in, they leave my stuff at the door, everyone is pleased. Not Purolator. So this large, heavy, expensive item is supposed to be here last week, so of course it only shows up this week - but whatever. COVID / Corona, blah blah - I get it. So you can imagine much to my disappointment where Purolator, now 2 for 2 (they've done this exact thing 2 times out of the 2 times Amazon sent stuff to me using them) shows up, doesn't even bother ringing the buzzer, slaps the ""sorry, we tried to deliver"" notice on on the lobby door and books it. The notice helpfully tells me that I can go get the item myself, tomorrow, at their depot. Do I get paid for doing a part of the job? Will I get reimbursed for the van I'd have to rent to get it here? Can I rent a dolly? If I wanted the joy of lugging a large oversized thing myself in a tiny sedan (which it can't fit into anyways), I'd have gone to a big box store to get it and not wait a week plus for it to show up. So, I call up their customer service to complain and ask them to try to actually deliver it. They tell me that they will try to re-deliver, tomorrow, maybe, if there's room on the truck / room in the schedule. Wow. When I ask why they couldn't even bother ringing my buzzer, they tried to feed me such a load of crap that they must have thought I was a compost bin. Apparently, my ringer number isn't on the shipping label (I say BS, since NO OTHER COURIER has had this issue) - but fine. I ask if it was too much trouble to look at the directory RIGHT BESIDE where they slapped the delivery attempted notice. I was told that they didn't have the time. To look at one sheet of paper, for the buzzer number. It literally takes 3 second to look at this alphabetized list, which is a lot less time than trying to deliver it again - but they don't have the time.Also, this is a total load of crap - they had no intention of trying to deliver - I know because the notice that I got about the attempted delivery says they tried to deliver at exactly 10:30 AM, even though the website for their tracking says the delivery attempt took place at 11:49 AM. So they clearly pre-wrote the ""sorry we missed you notice"" before they even showed up, because they had no intention of even trying to deliver (why else would it be pre-written with a fake time?). Can't check the directory, has no time, but has time to pre-write these labels. In the future, I will avoid doing business with any e-merchant that uses Purolator, because I like to get the stuff I order, and don't like being fed a bunch of indifferent BS by customer service agents whose only interest is defending the incompetents of their delivery staff. If you must use Purolator I recommend getting a lawn chair and downloading some good games, since you'll need to sit in front of your building the whole day to intercept these so called couriers if you want any chance of receiving your stuff.EDIT: 21/10/2020So, I spoke to a third customer service rep who confirmed that the representative I spoke to yesterday gave me violently incorrect information. Apparently, no delivery was made, because they were supposed to call to confirm a delivery time due to the item's size, which the rep admitted they never did. The rep who promised re-delivery today was also lying, since that is not the process for a parcel of this size. And the notice telling me to go get it myself was also incorrect. Needless to say, I still don't have the item, and I am waiting on a call from Purolator - they have another hour and 14 minutes to do so before I cancel the whole order and go with someone who will use UPS to ship it.So, 1 representative out of three actually provided useful information - and my thanks to that rep, at least I understand what happened. Still extremely unimpressed with EVERYONE other than that one CSR, who seems to be the only person over there who actually cared about doing their job. I'm sorry she has to work for such a garbage company - a more competent courier would be lucky to have her. Needless to say, package is still late, still no call, and the situation hasn't really changed. My rating stands, though I am impressed they actually read this review and bothered to respond after I emailed them as Catherine directed. I wasn't expected that - too bad it didn't seem to advance the delivery any.Date of experience: October 20, 2020"

I live in an apartment complex and my unit's buzzer number is the same as the unit number. My address through Amazon has the buzz number, and I presume when the shipping label is created, it would have the same information. Their usual couriers (Intelcomm) have enough courtesy and decency to actually read the address and deliver it to my door. But Purolater, that's another story! I waited ALL day for a large, expensive, heavy (90lbs) item. While I was waiting at home, I received an email notification stating that ""the receiver was unavailable."" The driver didn't even buzz the apartment, absolutely nothing! I don't even trust that they will even deliver the item undamaged (I've seen the videos of how they treat packages and lose them). For the past 7 years, they've been nothing short of awful. I absolutely DO NOT have the strength to carry a 90lbs item by myself, nor even a vehicle with the space requirements!

1951,Tina P,"I would no stars if I  couldI would no stars if I  could. My experience with Purolator as a shipping company has been beyond frustrating. Have had four different packages delivered to my address and four different experiences.  First one was great. I wasn't home and they left the pickup slip for the location that is conveniently located in my neighborhood. Way it should work!!!! Second package was carded for a different location in Brampton but taken to a location in Mississauga way out of my way, considering I don't drive and with all the craziness of covid very inconvenient to try and get to.  Called and arranged for redelivery for the following Friday since I would be home to receive.  They screwed up and sent it out on the Thursday. Luckily my daughter was off that day and home.  Lots of issues as these were cell phones that they were giving me a hard time about delivering as the package was in my husband's name and I have id showing same last name and address.  Had a third package taken yet again to a completely different drop off in Mississauga despite there being a drop off only 10 minutes from my home in Brampton.  What is with this inconvenient process and inconsistencies???? Today was the final straw. Ordered a hybrid bed in a box mattress from Amazon.  Purolator delivered it to the wrong house!!!!! Don't your drivers even verify an address??? I was at work when I got the notification that it was delivered and called my neighbor to check my doorstep.  Kinda hard to miss a box containing a queen sized memory foam mattress.  But it wasn't there!!! My neighbor found it on the doorstep of a house in the adjoining townhouse complex and was able to retrieve it for me much to my gratitude.

I once confronted a driver leaving a delivery slip at my last building right over the sign that says deliveries to concierge out back. Do you think he cared? No! He told me to my face that the concierge wasn't there. The 24/7 concierge wasn't there. Their drivers are lazy, and useless and will do literally anything to avoid doing their actual job.

So I tried to correct the address, using even Google Map to ensure the format of the address was ""ok"" and it didn't work. So I had to speak with them to get this right and she told me to expect another 1-2 delayed days for my shipping, just to learn that my package was already at their reception point,15mn from home. So I told her to cancel the shipping, that I would go picked up myself. She told me my package would be ready for pickup the next day.

1965,Sarka Kolacna,"Purolator incapable of delivering a package over a 15km distance in a weekI have a bed frame coming, it's a single package 68 lbs. Apparently it arrived at sort facility in Richmond BC on Friday Oct 9th, and tracking showed expected delivery Tue Oct 13th. Then early afternoon on Tuesday it changed to say package heavyweight, customer will be contacted to arrange delivery. I called Purolator, and after 1.5 hrs !!! on hold I finally talked to an agent who informed me that the package was never on a truck, and that it will require a truck with 2 drivers because that's standard for packages over 70 lbs (package is in fact under 70 lbs but whatever), and they will call me. I asked when I might expect the delivery, would it be Wednesday or later? She couldn't say, she didn't know when they'll be delivering to my area, but when they do they'll call me to give me a 3-hour window during which I should be expecting it. Seriously?! Wednesday morning tracking showed ""Appointment required for delivery, receiver will be contacted to reschedule."" No one called but an hour later tracking showed ""Unable to deliver - delivery date rescheduled"". So now it's Thursday 8:30pm, tracking info says 'expected delivery Thu Oct 15th' but no one called me all day and I think it's a safe bet that the delivery won't happen today. So my package has been sitting in Richmond, 15km from my home, for a week, for no good reason and without any attempt from their end to make arrangements. In contrast, I ordered something from the Netherlands on Monday and UPS delivered it today. That's a distance of 7,700km delivered in 3 days; while Purolator can't manage 15km in a week. If I had a truck, I'd go pick it up myself, but it won't fit in my car unfortunately. I had no choice in how the package would be shipped, but you can rest assured that in the future I will avoid Purolator at all costs.UPDATE: After writing this review I contacted Purolator again the following morning because the status changed to 'estimated delivery date not available'. Didn't call this time, I didn't have 1.5 hours to waste again; and the 'chat' on their website never loaded, wheel kept spinning. I tried FB and actually got a fairly quick response, and following that I was contacted by a customer service person via email. He was trying to help, promised to open an investigation, but couldn't tell me where my package was or when it might be delivered. And guess what? I got home from work that afternoon and found the package had meanwhile been left with the concierge in my building (those were my original instructions). So obviously I was very happy that my bed finally got delivered, but how is it possible that the representative I was emailing with that same day was unable to find out that my package was on a truck to be delivered literally as we were speaking?! And why was I told I'd be contacted to arrange a delivery when that wasn't the case?! What a mess. It really doesn't inspire any confidence in this company.Date of experience: October 16, 2020"

No calls from the buzz at the door, no calls on my personal number, wonder how the receiver's unavailability is determined. On top of this nonsense, they apparently ""Attempt Delivery"" only ONCE.

I interviewed with Purolator International.  I am a bachelor degree holder and former student athlete and was trying to find a 2nd job.(handsome resume for a warehouse job). The only thing I asked for was professionalism and to start by the end of the week to provide a paycheck the next Friday. Interview went great, Chelsea AND Purolator said I could start the next day. Generally, when you find a job, you cancel the other interviews for the day/week so I did. 30 to 45 minutes later, I get a call from Chelsea saying I can’t. Yet I cancelled multiple other interviews that would have been eligible to start this week. They made a mistake, but did not want to deal with the stress they caused somebody else in the subject of money and providing for family during a pandemic. Now I will have to wait 2 weeks for a paycheck because of their irresponsible and careless mistake on somebody else’s life.  Literally the only thing I asked for was professionalism. Chelsea, talked down to me as if I were a kid, an immature tone the entire time dealing with HER MISTAKE, and to top it all off, they cancelled the position due to my frustration of unprofessionalism. Not only did I interview with Purolator and listen to the recruiter absolutely degrade the current employee (only other job was Wendy’s) to me. Absolutely unprofessional. The entire interview was about how lazy and “doesn’t give a crap” With that being said, I didn’t get the job due to the unprofessionalism with Volt staffing. The phone call ended with Chelsea saying “let me coach you up a little bit kid.” Lol I don’t have to express my accolades to point out no staffing agency should ever talk to their candidates that way. To top it all off, they had another agent call me apologizing, saying it would be fixed (was not lol), and acting like they cared was only contacted after that so I wouldn’t leave a review like I said I would. I said I’d leave a review so this dog crap doesn’t happen to anybody else and their moods completely changed.

Their customer service is a joke, the rep on the phone says that the drives can't call or text to let the customer know they are on their way or if they arrived at the home. So it is not known when the package will be delivered because you could wast a bloody day waiting by the front door for Purolator.

2011,sarah ,"Purolator is the absolute worstPurolator is the absolute worst. I ordered  a package on Amazon on Sept 22. I was told that my package would arrive on Sept 24. I waited around all day on the 24th, which was yesterday, and nothing. Due to COVID-19, I expected it might take a few days longer, which is fine. But I went to bed early last night (at 8:30pm) because I had to be up early this morning. Then when I woke up this morning, I checked my Amazon account and see that Purolator tried to deliver my package—at almost 9pm last night. Who the heck delivers a package at 9pm? And why no phone call beforehand? I live in an apartment building so I went downstairs to see if they left one of those sticky pieces of paper with information on when they would deliver my package next. In the past, with other shipping companies, they would leave a slip of paper that said they would try again in 2 business days, or something like that. They did leave something. But it said that my package will be ready for pickup on Sept 28th at a location that will take me over half an hour to bus to. This is beyond frustrating. First off, I PAID for shipping so I expect the item to be shipped. I ordered a yoga mat. If I wanted to pick up, I could have gone to a local store and bought a yoga mat. Secondly, how about delivering my package before 7pm? That would have been reasonable. I live in Vancouver. After tracking my package, it says it arrived in Richmond on Sep 24 at around 2:30am. But it wasn't sent out for delivery until 11:30am. I understand it takes time to sort through all the packages, but come on. And then it took until almost 9pm (9½ hours) to be delivered? It takes about 30 to 40 min to drive from the furthest point in Richmond to where I live, and probably a bit longer in rush hour traffic. And probably longer if you are delivering packages along the way. But 10½ hours? And lastly, why not just wait until the following day to deliver it? When I could have received my package at a reasonable time?Date of experience: September 26, 2020"
2012,Jason Lisenchuk,"A Litany of Issues Experienced Far Too OftenDrivers frequently fail to receive, read or follow special instructions, such as alternative entrance to property (as main entrance is closed for repairs), entry code &c.All of this information is on my Amazon account, and either not passed through (on a reliable basis) to Purolator, or they somehow fail to act on it, or, and I hate to suggest this, some drivers are less than conscientious or truthful.The drivers do not have the ability to call me (as the receiver), and I know this could be done in a privacy-friendly way as certain other carriers do it.Lastly, Purolator apparently does not have the ability to add special instructions to an order that has yet to be loaded on a truck for delivery.  The call centre rep (who was actually very good) advised that I would have to phone back, once I saw via Amazon, that the order was on a truck for delivery.  I would have to ask at that time that the special instructions be relayed to the driver in question, i.e. the special instructions that have been on my Amazon shipping address for several months, and that no other carrier has a problem receiving, reading and following.And one more thing, I patiently waited until 8 am to use their online chat service, and there were NO agents online between 8:00 am and 8:05 am.  I was not put into queue at all, which suggests that no agent had logged into the queue.None of this is acceptable in Canada, in 2020 (pandemic or otherwise), and for a company of the size (and at least historically, the stature) of Purolator  What has happened to them over the past several years?Not certain if the special instructions issue is on the Purolator or Amazon side, or in between, but that is up to them to work out, and frankly not my problem.I can now say with conviction that the best carrier in Canada is Canada Post (XpressPost).  Good for Canada Post, and shame on Purolator.  This makes me wonder whether Purolator has a major problem in its management culture, in terms of accountability (or lack thereof) for operational excellence.Virtually every review is one star, so my experience is evidently not unique.  I will be writing to senior management at Purolator (and perhaps at Amazon Canada) to indicate my displeasure.This level of incompetence is costly to both companies, both financially and in terms of their respective reputations, and costly to me in terms of my time.Date of experience: September 26, 2020"

In waltzed a Purolator driver -- UNMASKED and seemingly defiant about it -- to stand at the counter where food is prepared in order to make a delivery. Leaving the cafe, I passed a Fedex truck driving on Hwy 89. The driver was masked. As Fedex proved, it's not impossible for a busy delivery driver to mask against Covid.

In one case following a late delivery for something I needed for an out of town trip, 2 days after expected delivery based upon 'tracking' (what a joke that is), I called and arranged to pick it up at the main receiving depot the following day on my way out of town.

However the delivery drivers for this company are so incompetent, inept and ignorant, its frankly astonishing how they can even survive day to day life, seeing as the thought to use the intercom, which any person with a degree of common sense would do, is absolutely foreign to them. ANYWAY, because of this incompetence, the delivery was failed because we were never able to let them in. My girlfriend was contacted today about how to get in the building, and the lady on the phone almost sounded offended that the delivery driver couldn't just walk into a secure building. Now we won't get our delivery until Monday. Bear in mind, the package is a food item which will probably have spoiled by the time its delivered on Monday, and thats if the delivery drivers have been taught to use their brain over the next two days.

The new useless excuse is 'Oversized' from the tracking page and the new excuse from customer service is 'the package requires special handling' for the safety of their employees.  So perhaps they should set the reel on one of its flat surfaces instead of its curved edge, and it will stop rolling over their employees feet. AAAGGGHHH!Date of experience: September 17, 2020"
2039,Kim Riel,"If I could give zero stars I would.If I could give zero stars I would.We are a business located on a highway outside of a rural SK town where the Purolator delivery truck is within a handful of kilometres of us in two different directions, but refuses to provide delivery services to us.  We used to have delivery, then they temporarily changed the route several years ago and have refused to change it back.  We receive deliveries from DHL, Fed Ex and UPS without any issue at all.We are at the point where we avoid ordering from companies that ship via Purolator if they can't choose a different carrier.  Companies that can choose a different courier get to keep our business.  We simply have no option considering these companies are paying Purolator for a service they're not getting (they pay for their packages to come to us, but that's not what happens).I have contacted Purolator customer service multiple times, their reps have confirmed we should have service here, pass us on to the regional manager who passes us on to the closest-to-us depot and any hope for resolution abruptly ends.  It's a waste of time, every time.I hope companies are reading these reviews and understand that they need to use anyone but Purolator if they want their customers to be happy.  Repeatedly picking a courier that fails to do their job reflects on the company sending the product too.Date of experience: September 17, 2020"

Heck I had been sitting near my phone and door all morning. No note. Nothing. We called them and after some disgruntled customer service ppl, they said they would deliver Thursday. Okay. So it came...today. Wed. What? How is that Thursday? Because it was a large package, I did not have the elevator to our condo covered that day. If the package scratched it, I'd be charged $250. But Purolator told me they'd come Thursday, so that's when I booked the cover.If that is not bad enough,  I find the package leaning precariously in my hallway.

Spent all day Friday waiting for an urgent package, only to be told it can't be delivered due to time constraints. When I called to confirm, they advised that it would be delivered ASAP on the next business day (Monday), and ""apologized"" for the inconvenience. They also recommended I don't hold for delivery, as it would just delay me getting the package. Today was told that they actually can't deliver it, and it needs to be sent to a depot for pickup, which is likely going to take another whole week given how terrible this service is.

It was supposed to be delivered 2 days ago but I had an appointment and couldn’t be home. When I passed my order to the store I specified that I was in a wheelchair and was very sick of 2 illnesses which doctors and specialists don’t know much about so that means no treatment no cure. The person doing the delivery was thoughtful enough not to leave a card for me to go pick it up. I can’t go out except for specialists appointments. The person came back today and called me before getting here to make sure I was home and to ask if I could come down and I told him that it would be hard for since the building is not adapted for disabled people. He said that he would come up and not to worry about a thing. Once he got to my apartment he had a beautiful smile and asked me if I was ok and if everything was good in case I needed help and gave me my parcel. He was the most caring person I have met in a long long time. He was caring and had a warm way of making me feel good instead of looking at me with pity like most delivery people that comes here. And I order everything online not being able to go out. He is a warm and charming person that carrier services should have more of people like him doing this job. He was amazing and I can’t thank him enough for the amazing service he provided helping me because of my situation. I don’t have his name unfortunately, but if he reads this the lady in the wheelchair with the two chihuahuas is thanking you for the amazing service.

In 2020 they write down delivery info manually, pen and paper? Get real. You don't have to be a genius to figure out the potential for errors and abuse with that kind of system.

2076,Tom Anderson,"ATTN: You can ask Amazon to avoid this carrierMy story would be a regurgitation of the 3,000 reviewers leaving 1 star. I'm going to share a solution, since Purolator does not provide one.‼️ASK AMAZON TO DEPRIORITIZE📉 PUROLATOR AS A CARRIER ON YOUR ACCOUNT‼️This works best when you have an existing order that has failed to deliver on time. Take the following steps:1. View ""Your Orders""2. Select the order that has failed to deliver3. Depending on how far out the delivery has been missed, you should see a ""Contact Us"" option, select it.4. Select the reason: ""Where's my stuff""5. Select the next relevant option, usually ""Shipment is late""6. This will give you 2 options to get in touch with amazon: Phone or Chat. Pick one7. Explain to the Amazon rep your problem, cite TrustPilot's 1-star rating from 95% of 3,000 reviews for Purolator8. They will offer to refund, you may be interested if you don't expect to see your purchased merchandise ever being delivered by Purolator9. Ask the rep to ""deprioritize Purolator as a carrier on my account""10. They will easily accept this request (they are already familiar with the carrier's failures), and it will take 3-5 business days to apply.Moving forward, you should no longer have to deal with this company, and with enough people opting out, this should trigger a signal for management to reconsider their relationship with the carrier.Date of experience: September 01, 2020"

After the hassle of dealing with both vendors, I called Purolator to ASK that they hold my REPLACEMENT package being sent to me from the 2nd vendor.  I am willing to drive to the Purolator depot and pick up my REPLACEMENT package myself.  The customer service rep, who was polite, informed me that Purolator's policy is to attempt delivery, at least once, before agreeing to hold your package for pickup.  At this point, that is unacceptable to me.  I asked to speak with a supervisor.  The supervisor reiterated the same information.  After some back and forth, he reluctantly agreed to hold my package for pickup.  He did his level best to defend, as he has to, but I can only imagine how many complaint calls he has to field from day-to-day.  Given the sheer volume of complaints on this thread alone, his job must be a very busy one nowadays.***At this point, Purolator is FULLY AWARE that they have VERY SERIOUS INTERNAL ISSUES.  I would hope that they are actively working to fix whatever is happening...whether it is poor operational policies that need to be changed, or potentially, an issue of dishonesty involving some of their employees...but there is definitely something WRONG.As suggested by another commenter, I will be verifying ALL future online purchases, to make certain that PUROLATOR, or any of their potential sub-contractors, are NOT responsible for delivery of my items.  If so, I will not place orders with those vendors.I've received ALL packages delivered by Canada Post, Amazon, etc...the only ""missing"" packages were sent via Purolator.  You decide for yourselves what may have happened.PUROLATOR'S MISSION:""Promises made, promises delivered.""  When you CANNOT keep your promises, I think it's time for a revision of the company vision.THIS IS NOT A HASSLE (x2, in a few short months) THAT I WANT OR NEED.  Not now, not in the future.I would be interested to know the TRUE percentage, or volume, of missing packages. Purolator knows these numbers, but are they willing to repair that damage they've inflicted upon themselves?QUESTION:Can this STILL be considered a TRUSTED courier/delivery service?*** I will update on follow-through, and whether I ACTUALLY receive my package this time.  I'm at the mercy of this customer service manager's promise to hold my package for pickup (though, he shouldn't have to, nor should I have to make this request, or travel to pick up my own package).My advice?

Even regular Canada Post service would have been capable of delivering this package faster. Waiting a week for Purolator to even allow the sender to talk with them or reach out to confirm details with the sender, is ludicrously slow.

Purolator, here’s a suggestion. When accepting orders from Amazon or any other seller that is delivering to a condo or building, state that you do not deliver to the receivers suite. Give us an option to back out of doing business with you. I am returning my item to Amazon and calling their customer service to report this, with this very reason behind it.

2092,P P (PP),"Return Package Missing - Refused to Provide Receipt Upon Dropoff!I bought a piece of electronics back in July 2020, but, I decided to return this back to the seller. I was provided with a prepaid return shipping label from the seller so I used this to return my package - just standard process. Upon dropping off my package at one of the official Purolator drop-off locations, I was not provided with a receipt or any form of confirmation to confirm that my package was dropped off - the clerk refused to provide one and told me to go home and check online to inquire the about status. Apparently, that is their return-package process, which is odd because Canada post would normally provide a receipt when you drop off any sort of packages. Having never dealt with Purolator before and seeing that the clerk was annoyed at my simple question (I was genuinely curious!) and seeing that the customer in front of me didn't receive  a receipt either, I didn't want to press further on the issue and accepted their verbal confirmation. The whole situation made me feel very uneasy as I felt that there is a gap in their where things could obviously go wrong due to their weak internal controls. Two weeks later, my return package still has not been received by the recipient on the other end. I checked the tracking on the return label and to my surprise (surprised that it went missing, not not so surprised of their weak controls), there was no confirmation of me dropping the package off to Purolator. Today, I checked with the office where I dropped off my package and the clerk there claims my package was never dropped off at their office - WHAT IN THE WORLD!!?! I have contacted corporate Purolator and hoping they'll help me resolve this issue. Now I'm worried that I'll be out by $400 that was out of my control.Purolator, please kindly improve your drop-off process - there are obvious gaps where packages can easily go missing without any traces.Date of experience: August 24, 2020"
2093,Jenny Yuen Christian,"Do not leave packages at a drop off location. They do not scan label as proof of drop-off!I bought shoes from Vans, who enclosed a pre-paid Purolator Ground return label (they created the label on Aug. 8). I packed up the shoes with the return packing label and used their prepaid shipping label to the outside. The closest drop off Purolator pick-up location that I found off your website was Double Double Convenience located at 927 Bloor St. W., Toronto. I dropped off the package around 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 16. When I entered the convenience store, there were two people -- maybe in their late teens, early 20s, male and female -- behind the counter. The man told me to leave the parcel in the pile of other packages on the floor which also had prepaid labels. Not having dealt with Purolator's drop-off protocols before, I left the parcel there. The man did not offer to scan my package or provide a receipt. I was told the Purolator driver would come later that day and scan the packages. But when I did not see movement with tracking online later that day and then the next day, I became concerned. Usually, when I drop Canada Post packages off, they scan at the post office and provide a receipt. Here, I was not given an option. If this package has indeed become lost or stolen, then I'm out nearly $200. It’s been a week now and they’ve opened up a trace investigation but no updates so far. If I would have known there is no liability on the company, I would have just gone direct to the Vans store to return the shoes.Date of experience: August 24, 2020"

I understand that it is a little larger than usual, and I’m not an unreasonable person. However, when I am told from Amazon that it will be delivered at a time, and additional 2 days from a location 1 hours away is acceptable. We are now on extra day 9 plus the original purchase date July 31. 15 days and still not delivered. I call and talk to the customer service people and get “it’s delayed” and when asked the estimated time of delivery, the answer is “I don’t know”. So let me get this straight, you have my product sitting in Etobicoke for 15 days and no idea when it will be delivered. My last conversation was “Wait till Monday, if there is no update to then I will track it”. Huh? You have been tracking it, according to your website it’s sitting there. What I don’t understand I have gotten larger boxes with heavier things in 24 to 48 hours from UPS and FedEX from a further distance, yet a pick up in Etobicoke to My house in the same province is delayed with no plan to deliver. This isn’t a company I will ever deal with again, and I have written a formal complaint to Amazon in regards to this lack of respect for purchased products.

My plan is affected and delayed by this incident and I will strongly suggest amazon prime not tu use purolator for your third party carriers anymore but use your own Amazon delivery or UPS or Canada Post.---------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:Online agents are nice and friendly, but after I have uploaded the new buzzer code and sit my ass all day at home to wait for the package, it is still ""ATTEMPTED DELIVERY"" lol. Just talked to an online agent and sent the request to return it to Amazon. Please avoid this company and thank you very much. I legit saw their truck but they told me that receiver is not avaliable like what lol. But whatever wish I can give them a negative score.Date of experience: August 14, 2020"
2119,Evashia Wilks,"Purolator is the worst courier companyPurolator is the worst courier company. I chose no stars because a delivery that I was expected to get 5 days ago has still not arrived. Know one seems to know their job. Very bad communication with employees and drivers. Misinformation of incorrect info. The delivery driver lied about not only attempted to deliver to my office but having the incorrect address. I have called them 2 to 3 times a day to verify my info and delivery on that day and I am yet to receive my package. After giving them details of the hours of operation the supervisor told me it's not guaranteed at that time frame. For God sake it's been 5 damn days.  I will never again use this courier company and will strongly suggest everyone to find a better courier company if you want to receive your package and with no excuses and lies.Date of experience: August 13, 2020"

He didnt even leave it at the admin office because he thought it is too heavy and wanted to help out by delivering it to my door!! how kind and sweet this person. he went beyond his job to help a client .

2122,Estel-Lia Trudel,"Worst courier service ever.Ordered an item through Amazon last weekend. I live just 2 hours of Toronto. We’re almost a week later and my item is still not delivered. First time the item was out, I waited all day at home, only to see at some point in the afternoon that Purolator said a delivery was attempted but no one was at home; I live in an apartment building, the delivery person never even buzzed our apartment number from the lobby. Because Purolator thinks it’s acceptable policy not to equip its delivery teams woth company cellphones, there is of course no way for them to call us when doing a delivery, so they don’t have to make the effort of contacting us and making sure the item can be delivered. There is also no way depots can call them once they’re out, so they can just claim to attempt deliveries when they don’t.I called the company. I was told the delivery would be done the next day. Hint: that didn’t happen. My item never moved the next day. I called again later that evening and even contacted Amazon. Was told for sure the item would be delivered the next morning. Fast forward to yesterday then. I’ll let you guess. We never received the package. It was out for delivery all day, but again, the delivery never happened. We sat at home, waiting, only to have a message appear at 7:30 PM saying it was now delayed due to the COVID pandemic.This service is completely unacceptable. Worst couriers ever.Date of experience: August 13, 2020"

2124,RJP,"Using Covid as an excuse for poor service?Do I have to give a star? How does this company rationalize their execrable (non) service? Like many others, I've ordered a product, a very expensive technical product, via Amazon. First, it sat in Etobicoke for 6 days. Finally, it made it to the west coast, sat in one depot for 2 days, at the next depot it got flagged ""Delayed due to current pandemic disruption"" and again today, same thing.In the meantime, I've received a half dozen other packages ordered at the same time or later from further away that took 48 hours at the longest -- some under 36 hours (none of those via Purolator).I agree with Busterfetcher that it looks like Purolator is using Covid to excuse their poor service.In future my shopping orders or anything else will be predicated on if the company does NOT use Purolator and I'd certainly never use them to serve my customers.Update: OK, I gave them a chance to resolve the issue and provided the tracking number. Surprise, here's the result:""Your shipment is delayed due to high volume during this pandemic crisis. Delivery will resume as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we are not able to confirm a delivery date at the moment.""Again, Purolator is the only courier that seems to be affected; I've received half a dozen items, ordered at the same time and later, that were delivered -- by other couriers -- in under 48 hours.Meanwhile, I've missed a deadline that was contingent on using the product that is in limbo within PuroLATER's awful system.Update #2I finally received my package ... but only after days of chasing them to do their job. As above I gave them a chance to track my package and was first rebuffed with the Covid excuse. When I told the respondent ""That's not good enough,"" they referred the issue to a tracer ... who never got back to me.Finally, I phoned the nearest depot, where it had for 4 days been flagged as ""Delayed by the current pandemic"" with no estimated date of delivery.Turns out, according to the polite agent there that the local driver had ""had an accident"" some days previously. I got a somewhat different story through the grapevine (from a driver that used to work for Purolator). Anyway, I told them that wasn't my problem -- Get a new driver and vehicle and do the job you're supposed to do -- deliver my package.It arrived the next day. Not that I would have known if I didn't check my doorstep. They didn't knock or ring the doorbell -- just left my $1500 purchase sitting outside.So, the suspicion in the title of my review proved to be correct.Date of experience: August 12, 2020"

I have dealt with a cross country move, losing work due to COVID, and struggling with money. Yet Purolator still manages to be the worst thing that I have had to endure since moving. I struggle to find words for how awful their service has been, so I wrote a poem instead:I click the order button,my fingers are crossed,which delivery carrier?Will my package get lost?An email comes through,I see blue and red,""please be Canada post"",it's Purolator instead.I audibly groan,I start to seethI do everything I can,to not fall down on my knees.How many delivery attempts?How long will this take?Do they have all my info?For goodness sake.Now I know,for the next two weeks,I will constantly worry,my outlook is bleak.A few weeks later,My parcel was due,I contact customer support,my anger to ensue.I open the chat bot,His little box face,greets me with a smile,I want to put it in it's place.""Why is my package late"",I type in frustration,""I don't understand the question"",it replies in elation.""I want to speak to a human""I'm at the end of my tether,""I need to gather some information""This is looking better!I type in my name,and email address,a second window opens,again I start to stress.No options to select,for a chat topic,My laptop's in hand,I try not to drop it.I pick up my phone,and type in the number,for customer support,knowing it might be a bummer.I get through to someone,my heart beats faster.Could this be the one?Or will it be a disaster?You guessed it rightand now I have to ventureall the way tothe ""nearest"" Distribution centre.I open google maps,to see where they are,and lo and behold,you can't get there without a car.I'm at the end of my rope,All hope seems lost.What can I dowithout incurring additional costs?I'm going to leave the poem there so you can be as left in the dark as to what happened next as I am.

But what I can never work out is how you can get so many and still be awful, it's insane. My driver turned up to my building with the package onboard, walked up to the concierge, and told them it was ""too heavy"" (41lbs) to get off the truck and then just left. In normal circumstances that's bad enough, but when you think about what's actually going on here it's even more bewildering. Honestly if you spend any amount of time thinking about the fact he would have had to load the package on to truck to start the day knowing full well he was never going to take it back off again, you would be right in thinking this person might be the worst person at their job in the world. Maybe ever?Other tidbits:- They don't give their drivers phones, so they allegedly have 0 methods of contacting their drivers whilst out on delivery.

Next day, the idiot redelivered the package back to me. I called Purolater again (and they have a hold time of about 45 minutes for every call, and their stupid website doesn't let you do any of this online) and told the person I talked to what had happened. He blamed me. He said I shouldn't have sent it back through Purolator but should have done a return through Amazon instead. I told him that I had done what Purolater had told me to do. He said it's very hard for the driver to know what packages were being sent back and what packages were being delivered and it wasn't his fault. Huh? If the driver is too stupid to keep the packages he's delivering straight, he shouldn't be a driver for a delivery company?I have another package that I'm currently waiting for that has been in their Etobicoke facility for over a week (I live in the downtown core).

The last time Purolator was supposed to deliver a package to my home I literally watched the guy run out of his truck with a slip, put it on my door without ringing the bell and then he proceeded to dart back to his truck. I whipped open the door and called out to him and you could tell he was caught off guard and then I waited until he got my package for me. The second time they did the same thing but I didn’t catch it in time.. had to drive 30 min to pick up my package at the centre. This time, I kept an eye on the tracking and when it said that it was out for delivery you better bet that I was ready to wait for the guy and bust open my door before he could take off (side note: I think it’s pretty messed up that I have to linger by my front window like a hungry animal waiting to strike in order to ensure that I get my package). Sure enough, when nothing shows up, I see that the estimated date has been pushed to 4 days from now. If it was any other delivery company I’d say ya okay they are doing their best with corona and the weekend ahead and then I’d happily wait but because it’s purolator.. it’s just soooooo typical like there is no effort at all.

JUST LIKE THE WARNING AND APOLOGY AT THE BEGINNING OF MESSAGE FOR THE ANTICIPATED DELAY DUE TO NEW SAFETY STANDARDS TRYING TO KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES SAFE AND HANDLING THE INCREASED CAPACITY SO MY ENTITLED ASS CAN GET MY STUFF.  I find the companies need to be cognizant of their employees safety so they can return home to their families somewhat inconvenient, but I guess they have a right to go home and enjoy their families and stuff too.I joked about the delay when the girl first answered and she chuckled and sincerely apologized for the wait and I advised her I was prepared for the wait (AS they had told me this at the beginning of the call) and was enjoying a beverage outside and enjoying the beautiful day and advised that I may be changing to a big boy drink soon.  She was a sweet and kind person and I enjoyed chatting with her and she suggested a few solutions. There was an urgency to receive the package, as the company that makes my stuff also has concerns about their employees lives and was a little backed up too. What audacity these companies have expecting me to be rational and allow extra time to get my STUFF so they can avert the possible death of one of their employees.  The girl cautioned that it could take up to 48 hours to get my STUFF, due to procedural issues of handling peoples STUFF that may be contaminated with  a lethal pathogen.  I was going to advise her that I am a very important person and want my STUFF when I want my STUFF, but she was very sweet and I could not find it in my stone heart to assert my demands as an entitled person.At 1:04  I received an email notice that they were beginning to try to find a rather large truck where they suspect my STUFF might be. I noted from the email  that they were located in New Brunswick and replied that was likely why they were so Kind. The Maritimes and Newfoundland have the Kindest and most generous people on the planet. They have way less STUFF than us important people but they will give you what they have if you need it more than they do. BTW Great place to visit. At 1:58pm  My important STUFF was delivered.I had not slept well the last 2 days waiting for my STUFF and now my STUFF was inferior to the STUFF they had shipped before, but it was still better than everyone else's STUFF so I guess i will need set them straight because I deserve the BEST STUFF. If I have time I will write a scathing review of their company too. However finally having my STUFF made for a good nights sleep so thank you Purolator for the good night sleep. Not sure if me being kind to kind people precipitated the express delivery but I think I read somewhere about treating others the way you would like to be treated and it had some type of benefit so i thought I might just try it. Now as a systems engineer I can tell you that the logistics of locating a parcel from a few thousand kilometres away in such a prompt and reliable way is pretty much top of the heap. For those of you that can not comprehend remember how frustrating it was when you lost your keys. Now think how hard it would be if those keys were lost amongst  a million  similar keys and you had to read a 10 digit code on each one to find your keys.  Now I have heard rumours of a virus that may be inserting a new feedback path to an already complex and sophisticated system and this may at times make the system meta-stable. (That means you are trying to find your keys in the pile of keys with your hands tied behind you back, while important people are kicking you in the A$$.)In closing I am eagerly awaiting Purolator to lose my STUFF again so I can have another enjoyable experience dealing with Purolator customer service. Hopefully they will take longer next time so I can enjoy my pleasant experience a bit longer. Hopefully I will not need to go to work later that day so I can kick back and enjoy a few big boy drinks in the outdoors of the beautiful country that I am entitled to live in  because I AM CANADIAN (tm) not because I AM ME.Be kind people. The only STUFF we really own is who we are so own Kindness and Love. ChinnerDate of experience: July 30, 2020"

Waited at home for my package to arrive. No one called my phone or rang the buzzer, and then I get an email saying that they were not able to access my building. I called right away, and they told me they ""did not have my buzzer number on file"" and that ""calling customer phone numbers is against standards"". I double checked my address on amazon, and my buzzer number was clearly listed. They proceeded to update the address and added the buzzer info, and told me to expect my package the next day. But some time after, I got another notification asking for an updated address, so I called them a second time just to double check the address and confirm.Next day arrives and I get yet another notification that it was not delivered and that I still need to update my address information. So I called for the third time and they said that it takes 48 HOURS for an address update request to go through... even though they already went to my building, have my updated address and told me to expect my package right away?

Ask for explanation they send for re delivery on 28th of July. They come and this time write ""cust not available..."" baloney someone was home all day. Sent to depot (an hour away) to hold for pickup. Call customer service on hold for 38 minutes! Finally get someone told them to cancel it and return it to sender.

I asked for redeliver twice as I am visiting my uncle's house and cannot pick it up at the store since the address on my driver license does not match. First time I requested online, second time by phone. Both times went well and smoothly. The lady I talked with was nice and patient, she helped me leave a note. But redeliver never happened, not even once. It showed online ""Redelivery has been arranged"" but simply no one care. I called this morning between 9:45-10:00 AM on 2020/07/27. The reception was extremely rude and unprofessional. She wont let me finish my EVERY sentence, yelled at me saying Purolator is not paid for second deliver. I asked for complain, she refused to do so, until I said I want to talk with your supervisor. More interestingly, the supervisor was nice, helped me with redeliver; However, when I asked what is going to happen to this rudeness complain and if anyone will get back to me, she said she will listen to the record and forward to her manager, but typically no one will get back to either her nor me. I also include this as reference, I am a Chinese-Canadian, and I have Chinese accent. I do not know if this is the case. For Purolator, if you do not provide redeliver, simply do not provide this option both online chat and by phone call.

I advised the CSR that this is not accurate because I have received dozens and dozens of packages over the course of the 4 years I have lived here. Never a single buzzer code was provided or used by a delivery person. And how on earth was a package successfully delivered 30 mins earlier?? No answer other than to keep parroting their outdated policy. I asked why didn’t the driver call me. “We don’t issue our drivers company cell phones” So instead I guess they make their drivers lug the package back to a warehouse and have it reshelved pending me having to call them and wait on hold for an hour. Then the CSR says she will update my account to say it’s okay to leave packages with concierge. Excuse me??? It’s always been that way and now during Covid, even more so. There are large clearly written signs at the entrance to my condo saying that no delivery people are allowed beyond the main entrance and to leave the packages on the supplied tables for the concierge to retrieve upon the delivery person departing the entranceway. This all occurred last Friday so I mistakenly figured it would go out for delivery again on Monday...WRONG again! CSR advises that the message she uploads to system saying that it’s okay to leave with concierge will not be seen by the warehouse until Monday evening so I may get it Tuesday or Wednesday but even then, they cannot guarantee it will be delivered. You would think they would have a quicker computer system to be able to get that package out of their warehouse (taking up space) and to the customer. Monday morning comes and I’m not expecting the package but I check the tracking for it and it now says “Incorrect Address” I call Purolator, wait another hour to speak to a CSR and he assures me it’s just an automated message and he sees I called in previously and that it will be on the truck tomorrow (Tuesday). I wake up Tuesday to see a new entry that day that says “Incorrect Address” again. I call back Purolator (wait the standard hour again) and ask why they can’t put it on the truck that comes to my condo everyday with other Purolator packages I have received since this debacle has occurred. She starts to parrot their contradictory policy and clearly has no intention of helping me. I ask if I can just go to the warehouse and pick it up the next day (thought giving them 24 hrs would be a good solution). WRONG again!!! “Sorry sir. If I put in that request to the system, it may take 48-72 hours to update and we can’t guarantee when the package would be available for you to pick up.” Unbelievable!!! I offer to do their job for them by going to pick it up from the warehouse or from a nearby pickup centre and they still can’t make that happen in under 3 days. It’s now Wednesday and yet another message uploaded to their tracker saying “Incorrect Address”. Now I think they are just screwing with me. But even if they aren’t,  they obviously must have the most outdated computer system I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. I’m all for solutions and not just complaining. Simple, old fashioned solution which Purolator refuses to grasp or implement. Pick up the phone call over to the warehouse and ask that package #123 be put on the truck tomorrow. “Sorry, can’t do that. Can only put a message in the computer thingy ma-jig and then it may or may not be seen by the warehouse this week and then we may or may not get it out to you this week.” Blah, blah, blah. I’ve already called Amazon to ask if I can make sure Purolator never delivers my packages. Unfortunately they can’t, but they did advise that Purolator can be placed on a “De-prioritzed” list which means they will be the last option for delivery of any of my parcels. Anything to try and ensure Purolator and their archaic business system are relegated to the heap of failed businesses.Update: Thursday morning, still says “Incorrect Address”. Figured I’d call in while I have my morning coffee and receive my excuse of the day. Was only on hold for 10 minutes and then the CSR that answered reviewed my file and immediately said “This shouldn’t be taking this long. I’m going to look into this right now”. Finally! Someone that knows how to do their job, takes pride in their job, and actually seems to care about the service they provide.

Knowing this, I thought they'd just leave a slip in the lobby with my name and information about where I could pick it up. I was wrong. Seeing the first ""Address incomplete"" notice two weeks ago, I had to contact Purolator myself, and found that I needed to contact the shipper to contact them to add my unit number (Seriously? what?) . So I did, but nobody has updated it on their end. I've contacted customer service again, 7 days out from the original shipment date, who said ""you might as well order another one"". We're now sitting at 2 weeks, 1 day. The address still says ""incomplete"", they've tried to deliver it 5 times, every time realising the unit number isn't on the package. What's worse, they keep trying to use the pandemic as an excuse for their poor customer service and terribly organised company structure. I even asked if I could set the package to pick up, well I'd have to contact the shipper to contact them to be able to pick it up (same position).

They love to say that your packages are out for delivery, then say they made a ""delivery attempt"" (on an item that doesn't require signature and can be left on the doorstep), only to then reschedule it for days in advance. Sometimes they'll even send it backwards to a previous location in their system, wait a week and then send it back. It's absolutely ridiculous.If you're buying something that ships from this company, don't expect to get your deliveries in a timely manner. For a company whose job is to literally deliver packages, they sure do have a hard time doing it.Slow deliveries, frequent non-deliveries (which they then tell the company that the customer requested a rescheduling of the order, which is false), and then they'll hold it until they feel in the mood to deliver it.Absolute nightmare.

The virtual assistant chat is messed up and it does not work when you ask it to transfer you into a chat with a live agent, the customer service calls are horrible, most of the times they don't work and goes straight to their automatic answering machine, but when they eventually do, the call waits are over half an hour long! Is that normal? I don't think so. Even with the pandemic going on, other delivery companies are still very fast, and very efficient. How come Purolator isn't?Date of experience: June 30, 2020"

The purolator person came at 8:20 pm and called our buzzer just once and ran away. Our place was noisy and I noticed the ring after a few seconds. I ran to elevator to catch him but he had left quite fast. He even didn't try to dial our buzzer one more time. I work during the week and can not go to their office during the week so I have to wait for next Saturday or I have to take a few hours off from work to go there and pick my package up from somewhere far from my home and work place.

And not one single CURTESYYY KNOCKKK (LIKE CANADA POST DOES) to allow the person who ordered the parcels to know that you are here with their package!

Why don't you treat other human beings how you expect to be treated you FKNG pieces of sh i ttt!! I am going to report you to the Better Business of Ontario so that you have no choice but to deliver people's packages in a respectful and Humane manner. Otherwise you all are going to get sued for people's stolen parcels! If somebody orders a small item...

2261,Melissa,"NEGLIGENT COMPANY W/ NO STANDARDSNegligent company with incredibly low standards. Hundreds of dollars in packages missing/stolen. Appeared as ""delivered at front door"". NO text notification, NO knock on door, and when I checked camera footage there was no truck on said delivery date. When opening up an investigation with Purolator, their GPS came back ""inconclusive"". They had ""exhuasted all their efforts"" and closed the file and discontinued responding. Absolutely appalling. Because of policy, Purolator is not responsible for reimbursing, rather the company you placed your order with takes responsibility for the items.  This not only encourages THEFT from all their drivers, it encourages negligence as to leaving packages out in the open because they're not going to be held liable or receive any consequences. NEVER ORDER FROM PUROLATOR, THEFT IS INEVITABLE DUE TO NEGLIGENCE AND EXPECT ZERO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS.I dealt with LOUISE BOHMER through customer service and she was incompetent, short, rude, unhelpful, and discontinued replying when I continued to ask for answers.Date of experience: June 25, 2020"

I ordered a vinyl record as a gift for father's day and have had to return it twice. In both instances, the packaging was severely dented and bent - the record itself was heavily damaged and essentially garbage. I called Purolator to see if there was a way that they could ensure this type of gross product damage could be avoided on return, to which they apathetically responded that there was not (using COVID as an excuse, of course). At this point, I've decided to refund my purchase rather than gamble with another return; this company clearly prioritizes rushed delivery over quality assurance.

2268,Ward Edmonds,"One of the worst experiences everOne of the worst experiences ever. I ordered a $50 item from BestBuy.ca. It was promptly shipped out but never arrived. I have done thousands of dollars in actual shipping cost with Purolator and can only imagine someone that does very little may be treated worse. I went online and tried the virtual agent. After 20 minutes it referred me to a live agent. No live agent available please use email. I emailed along with all tracking info and order numbers etc. I filled in all the lines and answered all the questions. I received a phone call saying there would be a follow up phone call. I did.  Again I had to go through every detail and was then told I would receive an email. I got the email and each time a different person and explained every detail. I was told on each occasion Purolator would check their GPS record to confirm it was delivered. No email contained previous conversations. That last email I got basically said their GPS co ordinates confirmed delivery, have a nice day. I made two requests for the GPS co-ordinates they say it was delivered to with no response. I strongly believe two weeks of frustration wasn't necessary. This item was for my daughters birthday in May. I had no other option than to order the same item which arrived today. I paid twice and got it once. BTW, Best Buy did not reply to my request to assist me as its their choice of courier. No response from them but it was not their fault, only in choosing a terrible company to service their customers. Ward EdmondsI want to add that I know about 5 or 6 of Purolators drivers and they are terrific. Professional and always drop my stuff at the same door. I have security cameras and there is no picture of a truck the day they confirmed in their GPS it was delivered. Most people are not aware........Purolator Inc. is a Canadian courier that is 91% owned by Canada Post, 7% owned by Rainmaker Investments Ltd. and 2% by others.    Just read the response below. Open a claim. How about simply give me the GPS co-ordinates Purolator says they delivered it to. Over and over it's just a stall tactic until you give up.Date of experience: June 23, 2020"

I receive out of order notices about my package only to tell me that my package arrived in the sorting facility around 6am. I understand it may not be on a truck that day. The following day I receive another notice that its just arrived at the sorting facility (again?). The following message is that its delayed due to covid. With the reopening of the country and so many people returning to work I can only assume that the reason they cannot fulfill there businesses primary function is that prior to covid they must have had some seriously substandard working environments that the company is scrambling to fix in light of covid while trying to get packages out.  All while certain levels of the company are relaxing putting extra and undue stress on the lower tier employees. My issue is not with the employees but the company as a whole.

Why not just email the notice to pick up directly and save the visit to put the sticker.

Then i was told it might be with private vender(which was a surprise) because all delivery personals are not working directly for purolator and they mostly follow their own policies and wills in delivery and returns. i was also directed to drive to main sorting and storage facility in ottawa which is 27 km oneway from my address to find out regarding my package( BTW that is the only facility in the middle of no where for ottawa resident in case you miss your package delivery at your address), and encounter with very unwelcoming employee of purlator. since june 8 till now there  Tracking website portal is not updated for anyfurther information.Not very much please with their services at all... be carefull in slecting your courier company espacially think 100 time if you are considering Purolator.Date of experience: June 10, 2020"

What if the apartment dosent have a buzzer code? The driver just disappears and not say anything? And then we have to opt in for re-delivery?.Or come all the way to your distant locations that don’t make any sense. Your drivers just appear and disappear, I wonder if this company launders money or something because  I don’t understand how you do business like this. Get your drivers a damn company phone.

May 28th comes around and I have no package. I send them an email which i haven't heard back from. I call them and end up waiting 20 minutes before i disconnect. Friday and nothing arrives and now my tracking info cannot be found cause its past the estimated arrival date. Weekend goes by and i check again on my tracking info Monday June 1st in the morning. At 7:34am my item is changed to unable to deliver due to the weight, Purolator will contact you in 24-48 hours. They KNEW how heavy it was from the original package info. I chat with their help bot and am told it was not delivered cause it requires 2 people to deliver and i ask to chat with a real person. Im transferred to a chat room which disconnects me immediately cause no one is free to talk. I then call them and wait on the phone for 20 minutes just be hung up on. I call them again, waiting about 10 minutes before i call again, and another 20 minutes goes by before I am once again hung up on.If this is how you treat your customer Purolator, the only explanation you are one of the most used services in Canada is because you paid off everyone to use only you. Your customer service is a joke, your reliability is shotty at best and although there are probably alot of good men and women working in your company, you spit on their reputation and work ethic because clearly you don't care about the customers.I'm aware there is a pandemic going on, but these problems have been around long before that and using it as an excuse for your pitful work, is disgraceful to us and the hard workers who actually are doing a good job.

2338,Ivan,"Pure HorrorMy wife ordered Dell’s laptop. Was showing as “on track for delivery” on Monday, May the 25th. Close to 9:00PM I’ve checked the entrance to our townhouse and to my surprise found a “missed delivery” notice. We have a rather loud doorbell, and were home the whole day, afternoon and evening (good Covid 19 times).Notice instructed us to pick up the package tomorrow in a store 6 blocks away - my wife went there on Tuesday, only to found that the store is temporarily closed - due to Covid 19, of course. I called Purolator support and after 30+ minutes of waiting got the actual live person. The line was terrible and the person barely spoke English, but he offered me to either pick up the package on 1378 Pender St. location (this horror story takes place in fair Vancouver, Canada), or to have it shipped to our address again. Now, either option was available only on Thursday, as according to the Purolator support person they were not working on Wednesdays (???). I opted for another delivery.Today, Wednesday, I checked the order on the website once more, hoping to see new delivery date and the updated status - and was surprised to find that the package is waiting to be picked up, but on the airport location! And it looked like that Wednesday was very much a working day. On the same website there was the information that package can be picked up by other person than being addressed to, for as long as the personal Id shows that the person lives on the same address.So I thought that I can spare my wife the drive to the airport, and armed with delivery stub and couple of Ids drove to the airport. That was a big mistake. Turned out that I cannot pick up the laptop instead of her, as that’s against Dell’s policy. Of course, there wasn’t a word about *possible exceptions* on Purolator’s website. It simply states that you can pick up a package that wasn’t addressed directly to you, for as long as you can produce the document showing that you live on the delivery address. Not true. Apparently there are exceptions. I was one.No amount of pleading and explaining the whole ordeal made an impression on Purolator’s clerk, nor her supervisor. They were listening to my long and boring story with some sort of trained stoicism, so at some point I figured that they must be listening to much worse on a daily bases, to the point of zoning out completely. This is where I turned back to my car, drove back home, picked up my wife, drove her back to the airport, so that she was able to, finally, pick her new laptop.It is beautiful and she loves it. I’ll make sure to never-ever buy anything that can possibly be shipped by Purolator. Will make a point to always ask about it.Ed: my response to Catherine, also sent to Purolator’s customer care email address.Dear Catherine,Shipment # was BHC000371970Think that this experience went far beyond customer’s happiness or unhappiness. Let’s focus just on facts of the “case”:1) Driver never bother to ring a doorbell. I have logs from my Ring door camera showing somebody indeed being in the front of my door at 7:48 on May the 25th, but they didn’t push the doorbell. Nor they knocked - we would have heard them, we were at home.2) The “missed delivery” stub sent us to the pickup place that was (and still is) closed due to Covid-19.3) Support person on your support line (a terrible experience on its own) told me that your company doesn’t work on Wednesdays, and also gave me the wrong pick-up address (1378 Pender St.).4) Figured (on your site) that the package was actually on Vancouver airport. Used chat feature and was actually advised that I can pick up the package myself (although it was addressed to my wife), for as long as I can present the Id that shows that I live on the same address.5) Which proved to be bogus information. Your clerks at Vancouver airport office also showed no flex nor sympathy for the whole sequence of “unfortunate events” - I was in for another round of driving before we finally got our little package.Catherine, I happen to work as an architect for large systems integration/ customer support (ordering, billing, delivering, etc.) software.

For the first item, the status update was delayed, so that I missed the delivery very early in the morning, even though I was home.  But there was no card left to say that they were unable to deliver - I only found out through the tracking status online.  After calling Customer Service, a new delivery was scheduled for today.  In the meantime, the tracking information on the other item also indicated expected delivery date as today.  I have been waiting all day and no delivery of either item.  Purlolator should at least have a system where the delivery person calls within a four hour span or when he is in the neighbourhood to say he will be dropping it off.  Many other technicians and home delivery services do that; there's no reason why Purolator can't.Date of experience: May 25, 2020"

Competition is drastically needed here so the big money grabbers get the wake up call thats so desperately needed here.\Edit on the edit now:got another package, too bad amazon dont let you say who to ship by.  this time it looks like the box which contained car window tint, something that cant be banged around or even dented or it fails, but it looks like the delivery driver decided they wanted to play some truck soccer with the box. dented, crushed, tape barely holding it together.  These copy and paste responses from their social media reps need to worry less about how many replies they can post and instead worry about the quality of their employees they are getting to deliver.  internal quality review by an outside company is drastically needed, but like every other monopoly in canada, nothing will change except the yachts Canadians keep paying for the CEOs.Date of experience: May 21, 2020"

At 6pm I realized it would not happen. I looked at my email and saw ""Your parcel was delivered"". Seriously???? There was no parcel at MY front door, so where did it go? I immediately phoned a supervisor of Purolator and he casually informed me that I'll only be able to contact the ""tracing team"" on Monday and it could take two days or longer for them to trace my parcel. From all the negative reviews about this company on Google, I'm clearly not the only one who thinks they are terribly inefficient and unreliable.

Purolators web site tracking system seemed to have lost it for two days.  A very nice delivery person dropped it off around 7 PM last night.

2393,AJ,"Multiple Delivery IssuesWhere to begin...First and foremost I would like to say Purolator has delivered packages to my address in the past with no issues before, as two weeks ago I have received a package from them. That being said, the completely dropped the ball on delivering a bike I ordered that was ""supposedly delivered to my door"" on May 4. At the time of this delivery that they claimed actually happened, my entire family was home and we received no phone call or knock on our door. We live in an apartment complex where you must buzz in to enter the building. I was even tracking the package and 10 minutes later it said it was delivered, I opened my front door to see nothing there. A week prior a delivery person knocked on our door to deliver a package from the same store (Sport Chek), which was *handed* to us. This time around this was not the case, and I am looking for answers to why this process was not the same. I contacted customer service, who then checked the delivery person's GPS to see if they did stop by my building, to which they claim they did and immediately closed my customer service ticket... except me and my entire family can confirm this person didn't knock on our door/make an effort to contact our apartment? I work from home and can easily hear if someone knocked on my door. I even checked our building lobby to see if they just left it there, and confirmed with our superintendent that this was not the case. I have contacted the shipper to see what else can be done, because it looks like Purolator doesn't have anymore insight or help for me. Either way, I am convinced I will never receive my package and will look for some sort of refund/claim. +1 complaint, Purolator seems to have a MAJOR glitch with sites that use the ""Address 2"" category when filling out shipment details. I see other people have complained about this issue, and can confirm this is an ongoing thing as I have also experienced it, with an order I paid for through Best Buy. I had no issues with this when other carriers (Canada Post/UPS/Fed Ex) deliver items to my door, but Purolator seems to perhaps accidentally cut off this part of the Address details when processing orders. For the record I use the same payment system each time for years, and have never had an issue with this until recently with Purolator. (I have emailed their customer support to get my address updated, but they have not done so over the weekend, thus I still won't receive my package today.)+2 complaint: I also I spent 5 minutes with their Automated Live Chat AI only for it to ""transfer me to a Live Agent"", to which no one was available and I could not go any further in this process but to close the window. To end this essay/rant, I would like to say mistakes do happen and with everything that is going on in today's world, it's completely understandable that processes may have changed. However, I still need to resolve my main issue as I paid for a package I have not received due to no fault of my own.Date of experience: May 11, 2020"

They have it and I cannot get it. No mother's day gift for my aging mother. I'm beyond upset and will no longer use them for shipping for any reason.Date of experience: May 10, 2020"
2395,Robert,"Worst Shipping Company in Canada by FarMy University shipped a textbook to me through Purolator. My unit number was in the second adress line like I have it for every shipment, but the package was not delivered due to ""incorrect adress"".I tried calling customer service and using their online chat, but couldn't get through to anyone. It took 3 days for me to finally get ahold of someone.The customer service rep I spoke to was nice, and was as helpful as he could be. Unfortunately, due to company policy literally any time I have a package coming through purolator I will have to go pick it up. My condo buzzer doesn't work, so I usually leave a note in the lobby asking drivers to leave it there. EVERY single other delivery company does this. Not purolator. They drive to the condo and when I can't answer the buzzer they bring it to therir depot. So every time anything is ordered through them I am forced to drive a long distance to pick it up. My University bookstore is less than 2 miles away, The depot is more than 14k. It is ridiculous that I have to drive further to pick up books from Purolator than I would to pick up my books if the store was open (Covid).EVERY OTHER COMPANY manages to deliver packages to me and do a good job. I will be trying to request a different courier anytime I order something.I will be canceling any items that ship with them in the future and letting the vendor know why. Because of Purolator I now have to drive to a pickup location as a vulnerable person during Covid-19 to pick up a textbook that was closer to me when it was shipped in the first place. I am out a textbook... hopefully I am able to get it soon enough to study for my first test.Date of experience: May 09, 2020"

Opened my package when it arrived, and despite ""fragile, handle with care"" being marked in bold, red letters on all sides of the box, clearly they don't know what that meant or simply cannot read, because 1/4 of the contents were smashed or damaged!!!

After having them claim a problem with my address I have always used and reading others reviews I had tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but they truly are just a terrible service. Will not respond to email or answer phone calls for 4 days now. I paid a fair bit extra for express shipping and I ended up having one package delivered to a wrong location in Truro on Monday resulting in me having to file a claim, the second package arrived to Purolator in my home town of Truro 5 days ago and still has not been delivered to me. Keep in mind this package travelled across Canada in 5 business days!

2398,Ashley Lane Virk,"It Happens But LiesFirst timer using them. Look things happens. Which is why I even gave it 2 stars. I want more confidence in this company. As of right now, they DID email me about my missing/ entitled ""delivered"" package. The email stated that the vendor authorized this unsigned package at delivery. (Apparantly being Covid times & a Sunday I was not home?!) Untrue. I was, all day. No knock, no ring, no email, no phone call.  Whats the definition of a vendor?  Im assuming Amazon. So I contacted them and they do not authorize signatures and/ or unsigned packages. They stated it's Purolator's decision. SO I wouldnt be upset if a package was late, but the tracking information doesn't go as far as their services in Vaughan, Ontario. No proof of delivery at my house address. AND no signature. No paper slip suggesting it be at Shoppers ie. nearest Canada Post. So far, Purolator you have (maybe non-purposefully) lied about a vendor's authorization. Just stating the facts.  Please compensate me for this. This happened ~2 weeks ago- still persisting.Only evidence given""it was left on a porch"". Generally speaking, most homes have porches or quick answer out. ""Our GPS shows it came to that address"". Alright, fair. Wheres the slip? Wheres the tracking info. needed for my end? Apparantly 2 parties (me, Amazon.ca support crew) in this do not have actual proof it came to my address, it halted tracking in Vaughan Ontario Canada.This has never happened with fedex, canada post & prime delivery.

They collected my parcel from Best Buy in Toronto on the 9th of April. Even though my address was in Toronto, I could see on their tracking system that it left Toronto and went to Montreal and other cities far from my address. I called them about 6 times and the response was that they were trying to locate my package. They had me recent invoices from best but etc. Told them my address had changed and that they had to deliver to new address when they eventually find it. Well, I will tell you now that a month later the tv has been delivered but to the old address. Their customer service lady Wendy Morly says yes she was aware I changed addresses but there was nothing they could do so they decided to just take it to the address I don’t live anymore. No apology no nothing. Just stated as a fact and that i have to suck it up because it is what it is. I requested to speak to the supervisor and she said he would be the one calling me back.

How is it I can order 90% of any items from Amazon and have them arrive at my address in less than 3 days? I can tell you...they use Intelcom, a private nonunion service. It's just ridiculous.

Your job is it pick up and deliver not just pick up and  who knows what happens to packages and then decide to just have it at your facility.

2447,Stephen,"Countless Missed DeliveriesWithout exception, the various packages which have been sent to me using Purolator have always resulted in a delivery attempted note being left and me having to pickup my package at their facility. As I have no car off my own, this necessitates bumming a ride from a friend to pickup my packages. It is this always a frustration when I see that a company is shipping with Purolator.I have had to particularly frustrating experiences with them. In the first, I was picking up a package and, as requested, provided photo ID. Unfortunately, my ID showed my previous address, so I was told that I had to show an official bill with my correct address. Thankfully, I was able after several minutes to produce a copy of my hydro bill from Hydro Quebec's website. During this time, the agent seemed very impatient with me, and refused to communicate with me in English, so I obliged and communicated as best in French and with all of the politeness I could. It seemed an extreme level of scrutiny.The second occasion was that I had two packages being delivered on the same truck (per tracking details, they each left the facility at the same time).One of these was a redelivery which, thankfully, the facility had contacted me to arrange. I left the delivery attempted ticket with my signature authorizing this and all other deliveries to be left without a signature. I had asked if the driver could call me upon arrival, as my buzzer does not function and other companies have done for me, but I was told that the drivers do not carry phones. This considered, I also propped open the lobby door to permit access to the building in case the driver did not notice the slip I had left.The driver left this package and took the signature not required slip, but did not feeling the second package and instead left a delivery attempted slip.I suppose I will now fill this one out, and hope that I can get through to have a redelivery attempt made, because I cannot legally ride with a friend to pickup the package as we are under stay at home orders in Quebec.Please, please, please contact your superiors and relay that no other delivery company is this particular about signature requirements. Every other courrier, FedEx, Canada Post, Intelcom Express, and UPS have managed to contact me or to deliver my packages. Purolator is the sole company with whom I have had this level of frustration.Date of experience: April 24, 2020"

2451,Kaede Lynn,"Careless ServiceCareless service. Didn't ring the buzzer. The company must be instructing employees to leave attempted delivery notices only, as I am seeing a plethora of bad reviews stating the same thing. I have recently had deliveries made by FedEx and Canada Post and each company rang my buzzer and helped assist me with heavy packages to my apartment door. In the case of Purolator however they just left an attempted delivery slip and drove away with a full truck of parcels back to the pickup facility. Which is weird because Ontario declared a state of emergency meaning breaking stay-at-home orders for anything other than groceries or pharmaceuticals is against the law. Meaning that any Purolator victims leaving home to go to the pickup facility are subject to a $1000 fine if stopped by authorities and/or contracting Covid19 and dying or killing someone else. And this has happened to me in the past several times last year so using Covid19 as an excuse is unfounded. Because I don't drive I will have to pay an Uber to take me to and from the pickup facility costing me around 35$. Hopefully Amazon with distance themselves from Purolator in response to consumer dissatisfaction. Otherwise, even Amazon risks losing business because of this company.All I ask is for Purolator to define was constitutes an attempted delivery and then pair their definition with the complaints logged on this website.Date of experience: April 23, 2020"

I am now worried because I have 3 more packages from Michaels and they are using Purolator! I need the item this week and it will be redelivered on Monday! Which is not my fault, the customer service (chat) Lori C. was too cold to talk too like I was talking to a robot and suggested me to just pick it up if I need the package. I don't have a car and if I have a car why would I choose the item to be shipped if I can just pick it up at Michaels which is the same area as Purolator's pickup centre and pay for a shipping fee? Fedex and UPS are better but I don't have a choice because Michaels are using them. Purolator should think of making it better or you will lose customers.Date of experience: April 22, 2020"

At 12:20pm on I decided to check the status and noticed the driver left 20 minutes ago after not delivering the package citing ""no buzzer code"".I contact customer support again, and got a bunch of BS thrown at me. Then I was told I could either pick it up myself tomorrow or wait for another delivery attempt the day after.

2499,Alexandra Meyer,"I dread any deliveries from them.I always dread when I order something online and I see the shipper is Purolator. I can honestly say that in the 4 years I have lived at my apartment, I have never successfully received a package. I ALWAYS get a notice, despite the fact that I am home all day...because I work from home. It's incredibly frustrating, not to mention time consuming to either have to call customer service or go pick up the package myself. They never attempt a second delivery either. Despite the numerous complaints over the years, I have seen no improvements whatsoever.Date of experience: April 06, 2020"
2500,Kristína Camerón,"This company leaks private info.Every single package that is delivered by Purolator goes wrong and I dread it (I am ordering through Amazon). 1. I never get a notice that an attempt of delivery was made. I end up seeing an email from Amazon. I was home all day! No attempt was made. One time, I took the day off to receive a huge delivery and not a single attempt was made. I ended up getting the package after the 3rd attempt and after being home all 3 times.2. Sometimes you're lucky and get a customer service rep that is courteous. Most times, they are rude and cut you off when you explain the situation. 3. This just happened today where I had a stranger call my cell phone as she was notified by email that a package she was to receive was apparently delivered and signed by me. She came to my building looking for her package, and we both figured out that Purolator provided my full name and full address to another person who was also expecting a package and accidentally sent that info to the other person.Purolator, my biggest concern right now is that you are providing my private information to complete strangers. How can your staff be so careless and make such a huge privacy error?

Was watching out my window all day and no purolator truck. When I called customer service, I was told the soonest I could have my package out for redelivery is Monday (maybe) or I can pick it up Monday (maybe) though deliveries go until 8pm per the initial delivery notice. Also spoke to a manager and was told he’d page the driver to “ask” rather than tell them to deliver it today as promised. Meaning another 5 hours of waiting on a package that will probably still not come today. Tones of both customer rep and manager were non-apologetic and more “oh well, can’t do anything, too bad”. I arranged for delivery today as I’m in the middle of a move and needed a specific item in there prior to moving, I don’t have a vehicle to pick up the shipment, and was avoiding having to go to a store to get the items I ordered because of the COVID-19 outbreak...It was an amazon order and amazon was more than friendly and gave me genuine apologies for the inconvenience and for even having me on hold. Purolator on the other hand, not helpful, not friendly, zero actual customer service.

The biggest issue is they don’t have a delivery time. How am I supposed to work around my school schedule, to be home for time of pickup if there’s not delivery time, and they don’t notify me it’s out for delivery until after they’ve “attempted” to deliver it.

2556,Kjel Erickson,"They consistently don't deliverI live part time in Alberta in a small town. Other couriers have no issues delivering to our address and on time. Purolator has never delivered on time and posts reasons for late delivery such as road outages and severe weather delays when there are no road outages or inclement weather of any kind. I'm convinced they view a rural delivery as an inconvenience and simply avoid it for as long as possible. I'm currently in Toronto. It seems Purolator is no better here. They 'attempted delivery' while blatantly disregarding clear delivery instructions, then informed me to to travel to Etobicoke for pickup which I am unable to do within their 5 business day window.In the future I will be requesting anyone shipping to me to use any option but Purolator.Date of experience: March 03, 2020"
2557,Jennifer Sawatzky,"The experience I've had with Purolator…The experience I've had with Purolator in the past hasn't been great and it doesn't seem to have changed. At my old job our packages would come through Purolator damaged and I worked at the cellphone company. You can't be damaging those packages because a damaged phone would cost the cellphone company thousands of dollars. Now my current experience. I was supposed to get a package last week and it never arrived. I looked at the tracking and the address needed to be corrected. So I got it corrected and it would arrive the next day. Well still no package and again my address needed to be corrected. So I did and then realized the address that was put on there in the first place was wrong, that is not Purolator a problem, but with the 2 times I corrected it, it should be the right address. So I talked to them a third time to fully correct the address and the representative told me the address couldn't be changed due to restrictions from the sender, BS. Why didn't the other 2 reps tell me that, instead of wasting my time. None of the reps were helpful at all. No apologies for the frustrations that I have had. I have worked in customer service long enough to know what good customer service is. And when someone is having frustrations with your company you apologize and empathize with the. Though it may not be your fault you represent the company. So horrible.Date of experience: March 02, 2020"

They say they “attempted to deliver” when they haven’t even been to your place, they say they “left a note” and there’s nothing at all.  They say “incorrect address” even though I have no issues with any other delivery companies (I live in Downtown Vancouver not at the top of some inaccessible mountain!).  They lie about not delivering because of “major weather event” LOL, how I love being lied to. This is the second time they fail to deliver my packages. I even called them to provide as much additional information as you probably could and still nothing. So I have to keep wasting my time calling them only for them to not bother.

2562,Jacqueline,"Delivering Nothing... Right to Your Door.If Purolator had a business motto, it would be ""Delivering nothing... right to your door.""This is absolutely, hands-down the WORST shipping service I've dealt with and, time and again, it never fails to be awful.To be clear, I did not personally choose this service; The Bay, who I ordered an item from, did, and I honestly have no idea why they choose Purolator to make their deliveries. In the end, it just makes The Bay look awful, as well.So... here was my most recent experience (but it's been reflective of other experiences in the past).Last week, I purchased a (very expensive) picture frame as a gift, and had it delivered by Purolator, via The Bay.When the frame arrived, it was in horrendous condition: the glass was shattered and the marble was cracked. To be fair, I have no way to verify whether The Bay sent it this way or if it was Purolator's sloppy handling of my item. Either way, it was not a good start.I called, on Monday, for a replacement, and The Bay sent it ""next day"", again with Purolator. I asked The Bay, on the call, if a signature was required, and they didn't know (huh?!). But... okay. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to spend my entire day waiting, at home, for the arrival of my package, so I consistently monitored the shipment details online. Mid-day, I noticed there was an ""exception"" on the shipment, so I called Purolator immediately (as I was beseeched to do online). The customer service agent advised me that a notice had been left on my door, that I would see once I arrived at home. Guess what? No notice! Nothing at all.I called back, and was then offered a whole different story from a different agent and was *promised* that, although they wouldn't be able to deliver the package on Wednesday, it would 100% arrive on Thursday. If I was to go out, I could leave a ""Permission to Leave"" slip on my front door. Done and DONE.It's now 6:00pm on Thursday, and I have no package. That's right. The employee at the depot ""forgot"" to load it. And how do I know this? Because I spent close to an hour (maybe more!) on the phone, hashing it out with various Purolator agents, throughout the course of the day. I wasted my time AND sat at home WAITING for a package that they couldn't figure out how to deliver. Isn't this their ONE JOB?!?The Bay's decision to use Purolator for their deliveries is an odd choice, given that I've consistently found Purolator to be the worst of the lot (and, clearly, I'm not the only one, considering their fabulous record of one-star reviews...). If one is not home, and a signature is required, Purolator will not leave a notice for you (as was the case with me), and you'll be forced to follow up with them 100 times (as was *also* the case with me) to try and track down your package... or drive to their middle-of-nowhere depot to retrieve it.My order was supposed to be an overnight delivery, arriving on Tuesday, and, when that didn't work out, Purolator ""guaranteed"" it would be re-delivered today (Thursday). Instead, it's been mishap after mishap and excuse after excuse.Needless to say, I'm disgusted and, while I love to praise good service (and I do!), I always feel it necessary to advise others when service is subpar or, in this case, miserable. If you need to ship something, I'd avoid Purolator like the plague. And, if The Bay wants happier customers, I'd recommend it consider a superior shipping service.***From hereon in, before I place ANY online order, I'll first be contacting the business to see which shipper they use, and, if they tell me it's Purolator, I'll let them know that, for this specific reason, I will not be placing my order.Date of experience: February 27, 2020"

2566,Anon,"The worse delivery companyI always dread whenever I order on Amazon, and see that they're using Purolator to deliver my package. I have always had bad experiences with them, but this one has been the worst. So I was expecting an important delivery Monday. Decided I'd work from home that day. No calls or knocks at all. I check my tracking id and see that my delivery was attempted. Ok, I go downstairs in my buildings lobby to search for a slip, and I find one inside the building, past the locked door. Ok, this means that he was able to gain access into my building, but was to lazy to come upstairs and knock on my door, or even call me to come downstairs to grab it. Great, the slip said my package would be available today after 6pm at one of their shipping centres that is 15kms away. Well now I drive around 25 minutes to their centre at around 7:30, the lady there can't find my package, she goes on a search for around an hour involving other people, and after an hour of waiting, I find out that the driver had left his truck locked without unloading his packages, had gone home, and no one has the keys to unlock his truck. Perfect, I tell them that I will return tomorrow and I specifically told them, and Customer support that I do not want my package redelivered, as I would pick it up in person.  Well, I go and track my package the following day, and see that my package is being redelivered. I find out that it is the exact same driver delivering my package, and that it far to late for them to reroute my package to my work address or a pick up location. So here's another day of not receiving my package. Thank you for the massive waste of time. I'm sure nothing will happen to the driver, and he will continue doing the absolute bare minimum.

I work, as many of us do, so naturally I asked about a very simple request to deliver the package after 6 PM or on weekends. Customer service was very rude and essentially told me to find a way to be home on delivery day or to request a pickup (even though I'd clarified I don't own a vehicle, why would I be ordering a mattress online if I did?). Additionally, they apparently don't even deliver on weekends (what kind of courier company doesn't do that in 2020?) so I don't know why I was told the original delivery date would be on a saturday.As this was an important item, I did, I took a day off work to receive it, and nothing, it got delayed until the next day because they 'couldn't find the unit number'. I called, and they verified they indeed DID have the unit number, and it was pushed until the next day, after using ANOTHER day off to receive it the next day AND calling that morning to make sure it was on the way, it also didn't arrive due to ""weather"" (even though it didn't even rain that day and I saw a couple of their trucks in the area throughout the day).

I caught it myself and called both Purolator and the company. The lady I spoke to said she would put a hold on the movement of the package until I could get it sorted out with the company because only they could change the delivery address. Well I got all that sorted out by 7am checked the tracking and the package was never held and was actually out for delivery to the wrong address. I’m talking a completely different province. So I called them again they said they would page the driver and make sure the redirect went through and that I should receive it the next day. Well for a whole week it was held in the sorting facility in the wrong province. I called every day asking what the status was and why it was just sitting there they kept telling me the next day I will receive it. On Wednesday a lady I spoke to actually said you can’t see that it’s left but I can and it’s for sure on it’s way to you. Well she flat out lied because the next morning it was back out for delivery to the wrong address AGAIN. So again I have to call in and explain everything again. Well finally they straighten it out and it makes it’s way to the right province supposed to be delivered today. Now at the end of the day after waiting at home all day I get notified it’s being held for weather delays and that it will be delivered on Monday. This was supposed to be an overnight delivery and by the time I get it it will be almost 2 full weeks. I’m usually pretty patient and understanding that sometimes things happen but when it’s taking this long went it shouldn’t have it makes me so frustrated and annoyed.Date of experience: February 01, 2020"
2597,Jen Storie,"I wish I could give 0 starsI wish I could give 0 stars. Warning. Long post ahead. We made an online purchase that was supposed to be delivered Jan 30th (yesterday). On the 29th, before bed, I checked the tracking numbers and Purolator claims they had ""attempted delivery"" on the 2 large items that day. Our items were a crib, and a crib mattress. For the mattress, the comment said they would attempt delivery again the following day (yesterday). They just left the crib at the pick up location. The pick up is less than a km away, but the point is, the crib does not fit in our cars-hence why we ordered it to be DELIVERED. The mattress never made it's way to us yesterday either (now 2 days of staying home waiting for the driver who has never-and will never, show up). I called Purolator and told them to resend it today. This will be the 3rd day we will be house bound waiting. We live in a walk up apartment. We have NEVER had them actually deliver anything to bolus. We ALWAYS need to go pick it up. What is the point of DELIVERING?? We would have purchased in a store if this was going to be the case.

They simply drive by and send an electronic message to force you to pick it up. 2 days of waiting completely wasted.Without question, Canada's worst courrier service.To be fair, the 3rd delivery was great.

2602,Autumn Myo,"Do A Better JobEvery single package I've gotten through Purolator has always just been left out in front of the door. Never in the mailbox or behind where the door would open. They also never knock, which I find a bit absurd personally. There is always someone home at my house, so you think they would knock. Specifically this one time, I received a call saying that they couldn't deliver my package, and I had to pick it up at one of their facilities, and this was during the afternoon where I knew that at least 5 people were home at the time. So I after work, I had to drive all the way down just to pick up a package that could've easily be delivered if they had knocked. I have a feeling that knocking on the door, and leaving packages out in the open is a part of their duties. It's just frustrating to find out a package that you've been expecting has already been delivered while you're at home, and you find out when you're randomly checking on the current whereabouts of your package online, only to have it said that it delivered an hour ago. Their customer service line doesn't do much either.

However amazon decided to deliver one package by themselves and other through Puralator. Amazon delivered my package by the promised date, puralator who promised to deliver the same date as amazon sent me an email saying DELIVERY ATTEMPTED. I called them right away so if the driver was around he could deliver but they said it was not possible for the driver to come. Then I checked my security cameras, and turns out driver never showed up at the time they said delivery attempted. I called them again and the other CSR could atleast accept their mistake and said driver had some issues and came back early. Today it’s 4th business day since their promised delivery date and still haven’t received the package, I am literally calling them everyday and they always come up with different excuses. I even went to their pickup location yesterday and but they denied me the package because it was at the delivery facility and they couldn’t reach there.

""We suck, we're an anachronism that deserves to go bankrupt, and we are not prepared to compete with modern courier services"". At least I wouldn't be personally insulted if they said that! Or, the common lie of ""Delivery Attempted"" when my Nest cam shows not a single Purolator truck going by all day. Social media person responding to this review - your job means nothing if management above you is comfortable lying to customers. I refuse to believe the company actually has a CEO. No one could willingly head an organzation this bad - it's impossible to imagine that level of shamelessness. The only plausible explanation is that the CEO is a double agent from a rival courier company, determined to take them down from the inside. I wish Amazon gave me a choice about my package delivery when a competent courier wasn't available. If my choice was A: storage locker, or B: Purolator, I would choose the locker every time.

In more than a few dozens of deliveries done by them, I can only remember three parcels being handed to me. Their drivers NEVER knock on your door or try to buzz in. All the times I was home, with the buzzer connects to my phone, I know it's their common practice to never even try to get to the recipients before leaving a slip. It makes one wonder whether they even have the packages in their truck, perhaps they only carry notice slips around. Even when they leave a notice for you to pick up, they consistently leave the wrong addresses to make you drive for 20 miles for nothing.I even feel bad for the very rare species of drivers at Purolator who actually do their job to deliver parcels. It's not a few bad apples, it's a few good apples among a sea of rotten ones.It's beyond the most basic human imagination why they can stay in business all these years. Other carriers do occasionally miss deliveries. When Purolator actually delivers, it's always a surprise.

2614,meng chen,"I wish I could give 0 ratingI wish I could give 0 rating for Purlator, the worst courier serviced I've ever used. My Parcel was supposed to be delivered to me on Jan 15th, 2020. It's been over due for more than one week now. I've filed a compliant and got an investigation started. Everyday I have to call the customer service to trace my parcel and was told again and again by their tracing specialist that they've resolved the issue and the parcel will be sent to me on the day we talked, but it never got delivered. On every single day it's not got delivered as promised, the status shows weather delay. Come on, everyone living in Metro Vancouver knows the road condition in the past few days. All roads are clear, all schools are open and everybody is going to work as usual. and I got my other parcels from other courier services everyday on schedule. Only PUROLATOR broke their promise.  The tracing specialist even told me she has sent a message to the the driver who is carrying my package and told him to make sure my parcel got delivered by the end of the day, otherwise leave it at the deport for me to go pick up on the second day. Guess what, no one listens to that, neither the drivers delivered my package, nor they leave it at the deport. The status show it's got on the vehicle for delivery everyday and at the end each day it's not delivered, the status shows weather delay, which we all know impossibly play a role in this matter. I keep calling the tracing specialist and the reply I got is there's nothing they can do further. they can only tell the driver deliver it as soon as possible or tell them leave it at the deport, which apparently now followed by any of their stuff at all. We paid money for this parcel to be delivered to me and now even the option to go pick it up myself is not available to me and I don't know if I can ever receive my parcel or not. I need this parcel for my Chinese festival party which was held Last Saturday and it all screwed up now.

NO other delivery service I have used has ever had any trouble ringing the buzzer and delivering a package; only Purolator seems to gets confused, and only Purolator seems to have a problem.

Shipped a package 2 months ago for one day service, which was actually 2 day delivery. Cancelled the shipment next morning and was to be returned to depot I had sent from and I would be called when it arrived. No phone call for a week, so I call and was told receiver refused and it was in transit to shipper. I explained I had canceled and was told I would get a call when it arrived at depot. No phone call, so call again a week later. Now I’m told shipper refused package, but I was the shipper and never got a call!!! Weeks go on dealing with the tracing department as now they are searching for my package. Tracing department finally says my package is lost and now make a claim. The following day, I get a call from the depot I shipped from and they say they located it, but unfortunately it was on route to Ontario by ground. Told it would be air freight back to Langley and would take 5-6 business days. 7 business days go by and no call, so I call and get told my package is still lost!!! Tracing department basically called me a liar, that the depot would not have called me and that I had to make a claim. So I make a claim and was told they would not pay because both shipper and receiver refused the package!!! I explain I, the shipper, never refused as I was never called to refuse. She than says she would look into it. The next day(today), I get a call from the depot I originally sent from, that my package arrived and ready for pick up!!! WOW!!!

I told him I would move my car to better access the door as the box was 139 lbs. The driver told me he was dropping the box off the truck as I got in my car. He did literally drop the box off an approximate 5 foot drop. He then dragged the box to the hinge side of the door even though the door was propped open. He then walked to the back of his truck. I walked around the door and attempted to make my 97 lb. body drag the 139 lb. box. The driver turned around and saw me and made the most rediculous and disrespectful statement, ""that's pretty heavy, darlin'"". I informed him I needed to get it in the door. It must sit outside for the next 5 hours until I can get someone here to help. The driver walked away.

I went to Mexico for my Christmas vacation and forgot my phone at home and my friend shipped it to the real estate company I rented my home from.  I was hoping to call my friends and family at Christmas so thought it was a good investment.  Not only did I not receive the phone in time, when I did receive it I had to pay an additional $160 in import fees because the proper documentation was not completed.  It was made clear at the shipping point why the package was being shipped and the contents.  Furthermore when there was a delay beyond the 5-day guarantee I contacted Purolator.  No one from Purolator contacted me with questions, I made the phone call and the agent agreed it should have been released.  At this point  I was asked again at that time what the shipment was and again explained it and was never asked to provide any documentation.

Their answer is that they have to let the first delivery attempt happen (which is doomed to fail based on my experience) before arranging for pickup. This is the most ridiculous rule I've ever seen. The remaining package status shows it has stayed in a sort facility for 3 days w/o any update. Asked Live Chat agent if there's anything he/she can do to help me, the reply is ""sorry"".

In tracing their routing for a package (one of the few things that seems to be in order), A package from Mississauga to Toronto gets sent to a ""Sorting facility"" for an entire day(?!?) is routed to North York (?!?) and then drive back to Toronto?  Where does that make any sense? And it is already about to be 2 days late and all the web chat people say is ""we do not guarantee delivery times"". Not entirely true: to do promise delivery dates and they used to do them. But it seems they have too much business that professionalism is no longer relevant to them.

A month later I’m receiving my package back . And it was suppose to be for Christmas . Apparently they don’t deliver personal items . On top of that I had to pay duties to get my own package back 🤬. ... now the kids didn’t get the costumes in time for the Xmas concert, I spend huge amount of time off of work to be on the phone with them( to list and relist every single item there was in this package. ) nobody ones told me that they don’t do it . Now after all THE stress that I had with this package, I have to fight to get my money back . I’m shocked .

Ha, more like Maybe-Later.My order was scheduled for delivery on Monday Dec 16th, there was a Maybe-Later truck outside my condo around 11 am, and I receive a failed delivery notice at 2:06 pm.  Wonder how the delivery failed – given I have a 24/7 concierge, loading dock and all the means to allow for a successful delivery.  Can’t be because the driver was useless, sat in their truck, and didn’t bother to lift the package because it weighed 75 pounds…..could it?  Oh, might I also add that my concierge confirms Maybe-Later never attempted to make a delivery/contact them.Good luck getting any kind of customer support from them either.  I called to 1) open a case against the lazy driver who never even attempted to do their job, and 2) re-schedule my delivery.  The agent I talked to assured me that my package would be delivered next day (Dec 17th) - but guess what, Maybe-Later now says they have high volumes and I won't be getting it until the 18th (If I'm lucky).

I book the day off in preparation in receiving the shipment and to make sure that nothing was damaged from the shipping or from the provider. The whole day passed by until I got an updated at 8PM saying ""Address correction required - no entry code"". The unit number is clearly provided on the address AND the buttons on the lobby literally displays the unit numbers on the building so you can buzz the unit. This only tells me that the driver just checks the address and ASSUMES that there is an entry code. I had no problems with any other shipping company EXCEPT Purolator. I just wasted my time and believed that the company would the deliver my shipment as promised but there was NO CARE at all with my shipment. The purolator driver did not even GO to the building otherwise he wouldve see that there is no entry code that he rightly so believes.

2733,Susan Rickwood,"This is the worst of the available…This is the worst of the available delivery services I have ever dealt with ... I live in the country and the nearest pick-up location is 40 minutes away with very limited hours of opening. I am disabled and cannot drive there (why I need to have things delivered!) and no one in my home can drive me there during their open hours. The last three parcels which were sent to me each was a bad experience. The next to last one was finding a valuable painting I had been left in a friends' will, sitting atop a fence post half way down my driveway.. it was dark and about to rain -- it was well packed but would have been destroyed. Most recently, I have called, used the ostensible ""live chat"" function (which is a virtual one that did not work so someone had to call me instead of putting a person on the chat). After the initial bad experience (not worth even describing) and the painting, I ordered something from a firm and it was not clear they used this company... 3 times a notice saying they had tried to deliver was found in the mailbox. First time I was sitting where I could see the driveway and saw a truck drive as far as the gate and back up and leave; after phoning and several calls with people at various levels, I was assured the package would be delivered the next day (although this took over an hour on top of the time on the ""virtual chat""); the drivers' handwriting was so fancy it was not possible to decipher some of the numbers in the tracking #. The next day, no tire tracks in the snow or footprints were seen when someone came home in the evening, but yet another ""pick up notice"" with a scrawled note which was unreadable and obviously meant for the manager. Several more calls.. and in each one, I told the long story, and asked by if a gate that I had mentioned in each all could not be opened by anyone, since a local 6 year old came to collect apples on our invitation and opened it with no problem. I mentioned the gate and the ease of opening each time but it was not until the last call from the driver's manager that after about 15 minutes of what is obviously what they are trained to say.. none of which was responsive to the issues in question, he FINALLY said ... oh our drivers are not permitted to open gates because 3 have been mauled by dogs. NICE TIME TO MENTION THIS. So I suggested that if the driver phoned me from the top of the drive and I knew what day they were coming and if a.m. or p.m. I would have the gate left open -- BUT THEY HAVE NO PHONES ""AS YET."" He had originally mentioned the driveway was long and the truck might get stuck in the snow, I mentioned that it is plowed by the person next door as soon as there is snow, but he said well they might need a tow truck.. and I asked, how they would get one without a phone. Some kind of old fashion CB radio /scanner type thing. I mentioned that as we were speaking there was a truck from Hyro (electric) company and a truck belonging to a tree surgeon in my drive and that thee is a turnaround at the bottom of the drive large enough for a fire truck to turn around, as required by law.   I was enraged and did not hide it. I had already ordered something from France that is quite expensive and only found out it is coming through Purolator not DHL as I had thought.  This ""manager"" was gong to text me his number after he called since I was being driven to a hospital appointment by a volunteer when we spoke and did not have pen and paper within reach. I never heard from him. My closing comment to him after all of his inept attempts to justify their drivers not having phones, etc. was then I guess I am not getting my shipment .... NO RESPONSE> So I am without the purchase that I should have had last Monday and needed by this past Friday, and trying to figure out how to deal with the soon to arrive international parcel. Sadly this means not being able to order things from several companies on whom I depend for some things, and am notifying them of the reason (but this does not resolve the issue that I will have to do without some essentials). FedEx, DHL, UPS and Canada Post all come to the door, some phone when they arrive at the top of the drive, and one sends pictures to my cell if they have left a small parcel in the mailbox or in a designated place.

The driver left the door knocker with only the driver ID# and the location where I was supposed to pick it up.  There was no tracking information nor a name for who the package belonged to.  I waited the day before going to pick it up where they said it was dropped off.  When I got there, there was no package for me.  I called Purolator and first they told me it WAS delivered, it was just on my step.  Ok.  Fool me once.  I went home and immediately checked.  No package.  Called back and they said it was actually dropped off at a different location.  The lady told me to leave a note on my door with all of the information (they eventually gave me the correct tracking info) and the driver will leave the package at my door.  I got home the next day, still no package.  Look online for the tracking info, it didn't even make it on the truck! So I had to drive to their main depot to pick it up (which is not in a convenient location).  The next delivery they were supposed to make, it says they had an error in the system and the package didn't get put on the truck, and the depot is closed - no option for pickup (too late on a Friday night).  The next day (Saturday) it says it is on the truck being delivered.  Wait all day.  Check tracking every hour or so.  Finally get updated that the driver was unable to deliver because there was some traffic issue preventing them from making it.  AT ALL.  Called the customer service number and told them just to leave it at the main depot and I will make the trek in two days to pick it up.  They put it on a truck on Monday anyways.  Try to deliver.  I guess I should have checked the tracking info again on Monday.  My fault.  I get to the depot and they say they don't have it, and it was attempted delivery, there should be a door sticker on my door, and can I come back tomorrow!  I am done with this company.

2742,Sam,"If only I could give zero stars.If only I could give zero stars.The purpose of having things delivered to your home is convenience. Purolator, unfortunately, does not seem to understand that and will do everything in their power to make the experience as difficult for you as possible. Let me paint you a picture. I recently had surgery and had to purchase a piece of equipment for my rehab. I ordered it to my home instead of going to buy one because I am currently immobile and can't leave my home, nevermind carry packages to and from a vehicle at a warehouse that is outside the city limits. I also live in an old building and the buzzer system doesn't work, so the purolator delivery staff are unable to enter my building. Canada Post has the same problem with deliveries, however, they follow the instructions I leave on the package to call my phone and I will let them in, it has never been an issue. Purolator refuses to make the slightest change to their procedures to allow for the regular convenience of having packages delivered to your doorstep. Unfortunately, Purolator won't change. So that means I have to stop supporting any businesses that use Purolator.Date of experience: December 06, 2019"

2746,rebecca,"LiesMy first package was not delivered because they said my address didn't exist. I can assure you, it does. It actually has a large sign out front with our street address in Big Bold letters. When I called to ask what was going on, the CSR told me she was on google maps and couldn't find the sign. I explained that google maps was showing a photos from 2016, and that the sign had been put up last year. And even if, there is still a number on our building with the street number. I was basically called a liar.  My second package - I received notice that driver attempted delivery but no one was home. I work from home, all day, and my doorbell is linked to my cell phone. I figured this must have been a mistake, and called to ask they please attempt to deliver again the next day. The next day, the same thing happens. I called and they asked me to make sure my doorbell was working. It is. They said the delivery driver was trying but couldn't get it to work. I had a UPS delivery literally 30 minutes later and no issues. We had food delivered and the driver figured it out. I live in unit 7, so you press the button marked 7. It's not that hard. Why can't a delivery driver, who delivers parcels for a living, figure this out. I think when its cold, snowy, streets are narrow, they just don't deliver.Date of experience: December 06, 2019"

2763,Consumer,"Delivery/driver140 main stThunder Bay, Ont I placed an order online (amazon) and was given a tracking number for Purolator to have said package delivered to me on Monday, Nov 25/19. I was home all day that day, as the day went on I kept checking out my window as I live in a secure apartment building with no buzzer. Later that day I decided to go check the tracking it said it was delivered at 1:18pm except it wasn’t, there was no package and no slip or attempt to get in the building to leave at my door on the third floor. I had called Purolator the next day to inquire about my missing package. The lady said they needed to do a trace on the vehicle and driver, in the meantime I went to our local depot to see if maybe it ended up back there. Nope, the manager of the depot was completely arrogant and not sympathetic to the fact they lost my sons Christmas gifts (package), she told me I’d have to call and open a case file in which I had already done. Once I told the woman she got more rude and refused to help further. Told me to wait for the call, on Wednesday nov 27/19 the trace specialist was very kind and compassionate even went an extra step to contact the driver. Thursday nov 28/18 I received my last call from the trace specialist a different lady this time who was not at all nice she went on to state the driver is sticking to his story about leaving it at MY door. How can one leave a package at MY door when I live in a secure apartment building and live on the top floor. IMPOSSIBLE, they then pushed blame on amazon and told me it’s their issue. She also added in that the driver made one attempt when they are to make one attempt leave a notice and try again didn’t happen he simply just left them outside of my apartment building on a main road to boot!!!

Apparently the driver ""attempted"" delivery at 4:15 pm, but could not enter because there wasn't a buzzer code.  There is a giant sign in my lobby that says buzz code is the unit number.  No other service has an issue, except Purolator.  If he tried where is the delivery slip in my lobby?  Not here. The tracking was not updated until 9:30 pm, and before that, I had used the chat help feature twice to determine the issue, one time, at 4:30 pm I was asked to provide the buzzer code which I did. 1-day service was paid for and its clearly never worth it.

This inevitably always happens and it's annoying every time, so I go to pick it up and the new guy at the job says ""oh, the package is in the other Purolator location"" he gives me the location. I immediately google where it is and it should be illegal for a shipping company to force a customer to drive 1 hour and 50 minutes to pick up a package. I'm considering getting video surveillance camera's, I can at least record what the delivery driver is doing outside my door and advise companies not to use this service if everyone else has the same experience as I do. Shipping companies have one job: Deliver packages from one location to another. Why does Purolator even exist as an option for shipping when other companies (Canada post, Amazon etc.) do this much better? Needless to say: The store I bought from online will not be seeing anymore business from me because I do not want to go through Purolator. @Purolator: I've read the other reviews. No one should have to call or email about their order in the first place.

So I will have to miss work or take time off just to pickup a stupid package. My hourly wage might actually be worth more then the actual item ordered. And they deliver only during working hours? And pickup location only during working hours? Why even bother calling yourself delivery company.Date of experience: November 16, 2019"

2789,Natika,"Absolutely terrible serviceAbsolutely terrible service! Just like others have said below, the delivery person never knocked, just left a note on the door saying no answer, but that's a lie as I had taken the day off and was right there as was my roommate. When I called to schedule redelivery, I was told they would try in the evening. Instead, they came at 9am, but left no 2nd note so my husband waited around from 3pm to 8pm & missed his workout for nothing. Then I did live chat & they told me they don't do evening service unless you pay a premium! Called again to speak to a manager who now claimed they never do evening service! Or weekend! and I would have to wait till Monday & be home or leave a note with my signature on the door exonerating them from any blame should someone steal my package. I never complain about poor service, but this is ridiculously bad!Update: Redelivery ended up coming on Saturday after all even though I was told Monday. Delivery person was confused when I said the manager claimed they don't do weekend or evening service, saying ""We deliver everyday until 8pm."" Box was banged up (deep scratch marks right through the fragile sticker & completely through the outer cardboard). Opened it to find mirror completely shattered despite very good inner packaging (not cracked - shattered). Called customer service to complain AGAIN and was told I couldn't start a claim till Monday. Being worried I would just get accused of breaking the mirror myself, I insisted she put a note on my file immediately which she said she'd do. We'll see.

So I go to Amazon tracking and it says that the driver tried to drop it off in Etobicoke ( it should be coming to Mississauga). Today rolls around, still no package and once again I find out, they tried to drop it off in Etobicoke .  So I call Purolator, explain everything,  she says she has no idea what's going on, they have Mississauga as  the address , then she switches to Toronto than back to Mississauga, then asks if it's Amazon. I say yes and she  basically blames it on them ( I had a sneaking suspicion that Amazon WAS NOT to blame though), so I  contact them.  The Amazon guy says no Purolator is the problem, not the shipper and not Amazon. So now, I am supposed to have it delivered again to the right place.. We'll see..Just fyi to the employees of Purolator. Etobicoke, and Mississauga are TWO DIFFERENT PLACES. Just because they're both in the Greater Toronto Area  doesn't mean you can just write Toronto on everything. This will be my first and hopefully last time using Purolator.

My sister told the delivery driver, and was worried about the condition it was in. So, the delivery driver said he will take it back to the depot to have “inspected”so if anything is broken they will be held responsible.. Thats fine and dandy, he also said they would delivery on the next day. And of course it wasn’t. My sister called the depot, and they said they forgot to put the item on the truck.. Most important this item is a bday gift. I ordered this item because I knew she would have it on time for her bday. Purolator had FAILED, NEVER AGAIN PUROLATOR. When I ordered  this item off EBay, it showed the store is 2 hrs away from my sister. It’s not like it came for a different country. It was just down the road, and the box was beaten up.

2804,Richard B,"If I could give a zero star rating for…If I could give a zero star rating for Purolator I would. :(I ultimately learned quite by accident (3 days after the fact) that Purolator came by my home last week to deliver a package (an envelope). The shipper (a financial institution) selected ""signature on delivery"". When Purolator came by I was out visiting my doctor. The Purolator driver didn't leave the envelope at my door (which is understandable), but the unforgivable thing is that he/she didn't leave a notice (the so-called ""door knocker card"") - there was nothing left for me to advise a delivery of an item was attempted. I didn't find out about the unsuccessful delivery until late Friday afternoon. When I then called Purolator to complain about the lack of a door knocker card left for me three days earlier the agent suggested that ""it might have blown away"" (yeah right!) and advised that I could drive to their depot/ship centre (on the other side of town from my location) to collect the envelope. I replied that would be a 2 hour round-trip in Friday evening rush hour traffic. I decided I would wait until Monday for Purolator to deliver the shipment to my home. It is now Sunday as I write, and of course I'm still waiting for a ""next day delivery"" envelope that was sent out to me 6 days ago. Great service, isn't it? And great value for money spent!This is the 2nd time in as many years that Purolator has messed up a delivery to me, in not leaving a notice of attempted delivery on both occasions.In my opinion Purolator is an unprofessional organization and they, judging by the online accounts I've read, appear to have a lot of uncaring drivers in their employ. Their Customer Service isn't overly helpful when you call them, but at least you can talk to someone there about an issue. Forget about calling the local Depot/Ship Centre.. they won't answer the phone! I let the phone ring for a full 10 minutes and there was no answer.Going forward I will try hard to avoid having anything sent by Purolator and instead insist on one of the competing courier companies that offers better reliability and a proven track record.Date of experience: November 03, 2019"

I went home to check not five minutes after the delivered notation showed up on my online amazon order status and there was no parcel there.

2815,Benjamin Stevens,"Are Most Delivery Companies In This Country This Terrible!?I ordered two packages, a week ago. Gave both of them the same address. Two days later, one of the packages arrived (It was sent by a different delivery company). But the one I ordered with Purolator did not. I checked my Amazon account, and was told that I entered an 'INCORRECT ADDRESS'. Apparently, the very house from which I type this, the one where I live in now, does not exist.I spoke to them over the phone the next day, and assured them, that my address is a real one, and that if they had any issues, they could deliver it to an alternative address (my business address). But nothing came of this call - there was no sign that they had paid attention; after checking the delivery process on Amazon, it's the same thing - 'INCORRECT ADDRESS'. So I talked to them a second time, and was assured that it would be delivered the next day. Another day came, but the package did not.So, I chatted with them a third time, this time - I was noticeably furious. And since it was a Friday - they do not perform deliveries on Weekends, so I will have to be waiting even longer. (Now, I can understand if it's a Sunday, but Saturday too? How they can afford to be so leisurely as to refuse deliveries on weekends is beyond me, honestly...) This serendipitous timing on my part made me feel even more cheerful towards them.By the way, they have a website, which has a so-called 'Live Chat'. Except it is not a Live Chat at all. It is just a standard two-way communication via their company email address. And it's certainly not a 'Live' chat - they will take hours, sometimes days to get back to you. In my case, the first time I tried to speak via 'Live Chat', I did not get a response until the very next day. I then sent them a followup email yesterday morning and even now, I still haven't received a response.This company seems to have little-to-no staff coordination, and zero punctuality with their Live Chat and delivery time. Even though I left my contact information on my Amazon Shipping address, they do not seem interested in contacting me to let me know about any delivery problems. Even though despite their faulty navigation system, my address is a real one, you can literally find it with a Google search, not to mention the fact that the very same day they attempted delivery, the other delivery company successfully delivered my item with no difficulty whatsoever. With their absolutely stellar navigation skills - I'm amazed the package even left the warehouse. I even received an email notifying me that they attempted to deliver my package but they 'missed' me. I received no such visit. There was no receipt left at the door certifying their attempted delivery, nor any kind of photo of the front door sent in the email. And if it were true that they had visited me, then that would mean that they had successfully found my address after all, in which case, it was a real address and not entered incorrectly! So - which is it then!?Final complaint - their automated mechanical Answerphone is a ridiculous waste of time; just put people through to a customer service representative immediately; I don't want to speak to a machine; let alone one who cannot clearly make out my pronunciation of letters and numbers. In Short: Purolator have got to be the worst Delivery company I have ever used. I'm not native to Canada, so I hope this is not what people consider standard delivery service here. I am furious that they cannot help me - all I want is the thing I ordered, I don't want it returned, I don't to be refunded, but for God's sake - it is as though they are inconveniencing me at every turn because they know I cannot do a damn thing about it.Date of experience: October 26, 2019"

IT DID NOT COME HERE. And now they say, ""well the computer says it was delivered so I can't help you"". Great, thanks so much for the robbery of this pregnant lady. Don't know how anyone sleeps at night any more. I called to find out what is going on and they said they would follow up. I had to call back myself because they didn't get back to me. I also emailed numerous times. Not surprisingly this has happened with purolator before. One time they took a signature from an imposter who even spelled my last name incorrect (hello!! The last name isn't spelled right!!) and that $200 parcel was never resolved and I didn't get a refund so even a signature doesn't help! Another time they refused to deliver a package to my husband saying it was delivered and then when we said it was not, they responded with: ""Oh, maybe it fell beneath or inbetween the seat ...""; the package was a part for a weight lifting set which would be larger than a jumbo box of cereal... fell beneath the seat my left foot. And they never did deliver that package either.... ""It fell between the seats, sorry can't help you"" is what we were told. What is going on in the minds of these criminals. This company is seriously mismanaged. I am so done with it. I have fully understood why so many family and friends have told us to never use purolator.

I have had enough just like most people I know have also. It's sad that the standard Canada post is more reliable than this company. I know this comment will fall on deaf ears because too many of the employees in this company simply don't care about their customers and it's simply a job, not a service they provide as evidenced by the amount of people who ""tried but can't"" help.

2823,Beatrice. ,"If I had a choice I would never use them...I made an account just for this review because I have had the misfortune of having to deal with Purolator several times as they seem to be the only people who deliver items to Canada from the US. There have been several times where a delivery attempt was made and they either didn't bother going up to the apartment door (when someone was home all day) or leave me a notice of delivery and if they did leave a notice, it was to pick up a package at a facility that is no where near where I live and would take over an hour to get to. They also have terrible customer service. I requested a redelivery, explaining that the front door is always open and not locked (apartment is above a business) so they can just come up and knock on the apartment door. I get a call the next day from a lady who said they won't be doing that. No explanation just a rude tone and barely helped me find another place to pick up the package. I told her to simply send it back because I wasn't going to spend two or three hours of my day picking up a package that they were too lazy to deliver. This last time when I had to deal with them, whoever attempted the delivery said there was no entry code, I live in an apartment above a business...there is no entry code or device to punch in any codes located anywhere. I explained this to the representative and asked if there was a way to put in a note that they could just open the door and come up but he said he already put that there is no entry code needed which wasn't what I was asking for. If I had a choice in delivery service I would avoid using them at all cost.

Our package was both delivered on the day it was requested, and was undeliverable because of an error. They first claimed the package was left at the front door (didn't specific which - the building has 2 - and didn't leave it at the 24 hour front desk which was 10 steps from the 2 doors) though there was no package at the front door, and the building front desk confirmed no one dropped a package off that day. Purolator put a trace through, and I didn't hear back until I contacted them nearly a week later. They claimed they tried to call my phone number and left ""multiple voicemails"" but I didn't have a single message on my phone or missed calls. I just got another ""error in delivery"" message again on the day I called, and zero help from customer service, other that I was wrong, and here's the number of the tracer so I could get some help.

They responded that, they can not guarantee that, but, do guarantee next day by 9:00pm.These were key documents, had we not had the guarantee, I would have hired someone to drive them to Edmonton.  Relying on the guarantee proved to be a poor decision on our part.When the documents were not delivered by 9:00am the next day, we were fine with that, but there was no tracking update, so we called to ask where they were.  The CSA said, the tracking will be updated by 10:00am.  That never happened, so we kept calling through the day and they kept telling us to wait until 9:00pm because they'll be delivered by that time.  9:00pm rolls around, and, no documents, and we call Purolator, and they're closed!The next day, they say they don't know where the documents are and will investigate.Date of experience: October 15, 2019"

I have to start teaching the music on Tuesday and it is essential for my lesson plans. It is Friday afternoon, on Thanksgiving break, and I have come into the school (an hour away from my house) SPECIFICALLY to sit and wait at the front door for the delivery of this package. I waited from 8am-3pm, despite the fact that I was supposed to be leaving for holidays with my family. We have pushed our departure time back, because Purolator's customer service agents couldn't give me any sort of estimated time of delivery. I have been sitting here for SEVEN HOURS at the front door of my school, without so much as leaving for a bathroom break and I just watched the delivery driver drive directly past the building, WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING and then update my package to ""Could not be delivered."" I did NOT pay for this service AND sit for 7 hours so that this driver could be lazy and not even bother to try to deliver it. I sat on hold for 30 minutes and am now being told I will be called back ""within 30 minutes."" This doesn't even include the actual delivery. This isn't even accounting for the fact that the first time I phoned in after the driver drove away, I waited on hold for 10 minutes and was disconnected from their lines before I even got the opportunity to speak to someone, so I had to wait all over again. Purolator's motto is, ""It's not a package, it's a promise."" All I can say is it better be promised a refund and compensation for this terrible service!Date of experience: October 11, 2019"

It would have even been easier to pick it up instead of using their service. I cannot express my frustration more. The drivers first attempted a work address while we're inside the building with so many other people and claimed the building is inaccessible.

If you aren't going to deliver to an apartment block or even make an attempt to deliver then please say so. Now the delivery has to wait until next week which is an inconvenience to say the least. I would never recommend Purolator over any other delivery service as the guy on the customer service line seemed like this wasn't a big deal.

Customer will be contacted to arrange delivery"". Fair enough...it's a bed, it very well might be hefty and sizeable. So I waited for someone to get in touch with me to make delivery arrangements while I periodically checked the tracking page to see if there were any changes (there weren't...it just displayed the same message ""Unable to deliver"" for days). NO ONE GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME. The package then must have spontaneously become ""deliverable"" because it suddenly arrived at my place days later while I was at work so I couldn't receive it and it ended up at a pick-up location. So Purolator, what was it? Was it heavyweight or not? Because you initially thought it was too heavy to be delivered and if so, why did no one call me so we could arrange a specific time and date for delivery? You then went ahead and attempted to deliver it even though it was deemed ""heavyweight"" but you neglected to indicate in the tracking that it was out for delivery so I had no idea that it was going to arrive at my place on the day that it did. I ended up going to get the bed myself from the pick-up location since I no longer trusted you guys to make another delivery attempt. I hope to never encounter your company in the future ever again.

In Toronto, if you are not at home, instead leaving the parcel at the closer location to your home, you had to go to their main location, on Kipling to collect your package.  For some that means to cross half of town to pick your parcel! So why do I even bother getting delivery?  What is more, they have a terrible customer service, lack of common sense, and online tracking system that is awful. I tried to talk to them, the lady from customer service was nice, but without power so, I asked for the supervisor.  Except telling me that he doesn’t understand what I am saying (in spite of the fact that the lady from customer service definitely told him the problem) he was so condescend and with no appeal to solve my problem.  In his opinion is my fault because I didn’t call them to tell them at what location I want to be delivered my parcel!!!   Why this people don’t think! They know my address, they could find the closer location to my home and they should leave my parcel there.  This is the normal thing to do! But not for Purolator!!!!  And I know why.  They don’t care about the clients! The Supervisor who talked to me last night didn’t have any consideration, any wish to solve the problem, any willing to fix things.

The driver for our area personally assured me he would deliver to our home as we live 2 houses beside his delivery route. I have 2 children now and am unable to drive for a year due to medical reasons. This was a great help obviously, as I use Amazon frequently to meet our needs. Unfortunately what was promised was never delivered LITERALLY. This driver went as far as saying he would direct bill his company for the extra time spent on the drop off ( The 5 minutes extra!!). At the location where my parcels end up being dropped off pick up, the staff very openly state this driver is, ""lazy and unmotivated. He does not like to work"" This is very clear. When I complained to purolator about this issue I was told on multiple occasions we would re-deliver to my home which he did, however this was after I had to call to complain that I physically could not go pick up my parcel. Now today I have called for yet ANOTHER non delivery and am told "" the driver can not deliver to your area"" Seriously?!?!! What a joke this company is. I am calling Amazon to ask them to blacklist their services from my area.Date of experience: September 19, 2019"

2875,Sergio,"I have to write this bad reviewI have to write this bad review. I bought a present on Amazon and it was supposed to be there the last week. I'm not the receiver so it's pretty much more difficult to manage the situation. They just don't want to deliver the shipment. At the beginning I thought it would've been a small problem with no stress, but it ended up being such a silly stressful problem. They cannot delivery because of a buzzer code, which is easily accessible at the door, where is a panel with the numbers. They also called the receiver and ""updated the address with the entry code"" which somehow got lost by itself.Guys, I want my present to be delivered to the receiver, it was supposed to be a surprise present. I'm so disappointed, this happened before but I did give you guys a second chance, such a big mistake. I'll have to travel to Canada to pick it up by myself. Well, at least I'm gonna meet the receiver, just for a failing shipment. Hope I don't get any problem while picking it up.

2883,Pete,"Worst. Service. EverSimilar to every other review here I am gobsmacked at how poor the service is with Purolator.  Two orders in a row within a two-week period from Amazon and am told by Purolator they are unable to access our home.  Talking with a customer service rep did absolutely no good and they made a point of letting me know they could care less.With one order it was 3 different excuses.  No one to leave package with; unable to access residence; etc.We live 15 minutes outside the city and every other courier is able to find us, including the no name generic couriers Amazon uses.  Either me or my wife have been home every time they claim to have tried to deliver and we've never seen any sign of them.  And believe me, when you're on an acreage, you notice when people are driving up.Now with this next order, it's the same crap just added one excuse to the repertoire - a breakdown with the delivery vehicle, delivery scheduled for next business day.  Next business day has come and gone and no delivery. Couldn't be more surprised.  This will now go on for the next two days and I'll finally be left to pick my package up at an inconvenient location, yet again (a 45 minute drive one way).If Purolator doesn't want to deliver outside the city then please, in the future, reject the Amazon shipment.  As I say, the no name guys are happy to take the business and my packages always arrive - on time. I will be contacting Amazon as well and asking them to deprioritize Purolator for our future shipments. Apparently this is an option; I have a relative that works for Amazon and they have suggested this route.  Have also asked them to escalate my concerns internally - this is a joke.UPDATE: So it is possible.  My order did actually show up - very late but it did actually make it here.  So it is possible.

Then the person on the phone says the soonest it could be delivered was the Monday after the weekend. Monday came still not here. I called they said for some reason it’s still at the facility and said it would be shipped and arrive on Tuesday. Tuesday comes still nothing here, now they say “delivery scheduled for next business day” so this is now my 3rd time calling them asking what’s going on and they skate around my questions with no real answer. I demanded I wanted my stuff on Wednesday and they promised it would be there. Now it’s Wednesday, I waited outside my house the whole entire day no truck in sight. I check the tracking number around 5:30 Wednesday and another notice saying “receiver inaccessible. I’ve waited over a week now! Purolator is absolutely the worst shipping company ever.

2919,I Watson,"Just like their owners Canada PostJust like their owners Canada Post, I think they are both competing to see who is the worst delivery company.  Neither one can tell you the truth when you call in to their customer service departments they both blame each other.  The reason I mention Canada Post is because Purolator are using them as the last mile for delivery in my rural community.  It takes two days to transfer a package then Canada Post do not update their tracking information online the same as Purolator by the way.  This is to circumvent anyone from measuring their performance.  Because for a few days they can say they haven't received the package yet from the shipper and only the label has been created electronically, all the while they actually do have it but haven't scanned it.  So when they do deliver the parcel they could still be within the delivery window because technically they didn't receive it for two days.  When you call CP they say you have to call Purolator for issues so when you call Purolator their customer service manger tells you he can't tell CP how to run their business, in other words he doesn't care they need to change their customer care department to ""Customer we don't care department"".  In other countries you can see on a google map the actually truck your package is on and can track it in real time.  Even when the parcel is in the depot you should be able to track it.  Canada Post and Purolator are still in the dark ages.

They switched me to Canada Post Or mainly Dynamax and everything went really smooth always on time never one item late. Now Amazon shipped 1 item using them again and as usual, it is late arrived in Winnipeg Tuesday 2:13 AM, now again says delayed and should be delivered by THursday.

Updates seemed to come through showing promise that it would arrive on time. Then unexpected, received an update saying that further directions are required to complete the delivery! Beware using Purolator! These guys literally live in the stone age and do not know how to use a GPS or have a mobile device that contains a map application. Either that, or the driver was lazy (most likely scenario) and found the location out of his/her way despite his day ending in 3 hours from when he was located in the area. Now, I'll have to go to the pickup center and spend a whole lot of time getting there, waiting there, and getting back.

2926,Tatiana K,"Avoid at any costsAvoid at any costs. The delivery attempt to the apartment building will be equal to knocking on the building front door (not buzzing in). Then the driver will leave your package at the location with the most inconvenient hours and will stamp wrong hours on the slip. Then you'll try to arrange for a package movement, which will fail. You'll spent hours with CSR assuring your problem is being taken care of. You'll be told that a formal complaint is open but you'll never hear from manager. And finally, Amazon will tell you that your package was actually delivered while you had no sight of it. After all, some social media kids will ask to email them your tracking number, so they can investigate the delivery, while this is just a sham to create an impression that somebody actually cares and does a meaningful accident review.

Avoid.Of all the deliveries I've had since moving near Downtown Vancouver, every single one delivered by Purolator has been late or gone awry. Their tracking information doesn't help much due to being incorrect, talking to call centre staff is pointless and the depot staff don't know what is going on most of the time either. I have also been outright lied to about delivery attempts that simply weren't made and ""large"" items being late because they need to arrange a scheduled delivery time due to requiring a two man team. Interestingly no one bothered to contact me about scheduling any deliveries and all the ""large"" items eventually turned up randomly days later with just a single delivery driver.Date of experience: August 17, 2019"

My post office suggested I get a Flex Delivery address which allows my on-line shopping to be delivered to my local Post Office.  I thought this would be an ideal solution.  But no, Purolator said they would only deliver to a ""real address"" .  What's not real about a Post Office?  In this day and age you'd think they'd have figured this out.  Lot's of people live in remote locations that are difficult to deliver to.  They also won't release the parcel unless I have ID which shows I live at the Post Office because that is the address I gave.  This is totally ridiculous.  Very disappointed.

2936,N,"I will not deal with Purolator at all!I will not deal with Purolator at all!I have been boycotting Purolator for a while now. Last time, I ordered a package from BC to be shipped to me in Mississauga, ON, I never got it. Purolator informed me via sticker on my door to pick it up from their location. Oh BTW, someone was home all day when they left me a note on the door...(small apartment not 10 bedroom palace)...so imagine the surprise/confusion on my face when I discovered Purolator notice on my door. By that point I had it with them, so I just had them return the shipment to the shipper. And ever since I decided to continue to boycott them, I had no issues with any of my packages. Few days ago, I ordered something from Amazon. I've been doing so for years and never had an issue until now because Amazon selected Purolator to deliver me the package. I knew I will never get it and I have not. Amazon was kind enough to issue me a refund and file a complaint to their relevant department regarding my experience with Purolator. On Sunday, Purolator attempted to deliver but could not gain access into my building. Again, such a shame as everyone was at home and we are in the building system, but hey. I find about it on Monday because I checked the tracking code. On Monday, at noon tracking  shows 'incorrect address'. I contact them via live chat and phone (20min wait for someone to pick up). I provide them with my buzzer code, which apparently they needed. I get informed that package will be delivered on Tuesday. But at 8PM, tracking code shows that they attempted to deliver anyway. Uhm, Ok!? I'm confused. On Tuesday, I check the tracking code and it shows that it is on the truck out for delivery. Excellent! Someone is at home! They have the buzzer code! It will work this time! Nope! Around 1PM, my tracking code spits out red sentence ""address correction required - incomplete unit or apt number""....now, lets just all take a moment to laugh. This is Amazon purchase, not some old mom&pop store that did not fill out my apartment number. So I contact Purolator again via live chat. Agent tells me something completely different. Agent informs me that buzzer code was submitted after delivery cut off so my package will be delivered on Wednesday. HUH!? I'm lost. Amazon lady informed me that it seems my package is lost in transit. Which one is it, Pulorator!? Actually, I do not care. Honestly. I am just leaving this review for other potential customers.

The first agent (Mellisa) was helpful suggesting I try chatting again in the afternoon. The second agent was less than helpful..at first saying the tracking number given to me by Purolator didn't exist. She refused to do anything for me like identify which driver had my parcel (A flat Screen Television). She told me her information, that she suddenly found indicated the driver was to leave the TV outside the apartment building entrance????!!! No signature required. duh...I told her I didn't think that would work somehow...did she think that would work? At the end of the live chat she told me she could do nothing for me.

It was only after I checked the status of my package on Amazon—a week later!—that I saw that the package had been marked as ""delivered."" Delivered? Huh? Apparently, holding a package hostage for seven days, 20km from where I live, is Purolator's definition of a successful delivery. So now I have to travel 20km to pick up my package and I don't even have a notification slip. I'm not holding my breath that this will go well.Here's the bottom-line. Given the overwhelming volume of negative reviews it is obvious that this company is complete garbage, and there are enough competitors out there that they should be driven into bankruptcy, which is where the belong. The only question is how to expedite their demise. To all disappointed Purolator customers I propose that you call and/or email any company that you do business with and inform them that you will suspend doing any further business with them until they switch to a different courier. The more said companies/sellers receive such emails the more likely they are to act. These should not be idle threats. If Amazon is shipping through Purolotor, tell Amazon to stop and that you'll be buying your books through one of their online competitors until they do. Likewise, when buying on Ebay, send a message to the seller that you prefer that they NOT ship with Purolator. I have already notified several of Amazon's Marketplace sellers to discontinue shipping with Purolator.If the above doesn't work quickly enough then the next step is a Class Action lawsuit, since Purolator's service, or lack thereof, borders on fraud.

Sort of hard to understand since I literally had something delivered by them a few days ago!I got a call telling me to call them back and either give them an alternate address to send to or they can send to a pick up location. I called to see if they could try to re-deliver just as I had done sooo many times in the past when I have had this exact same issue. I spoke to a CR person who was of no help and was rude, she said she can see my item is on a truck but can't tell me where the truck is going. So instead of waiting for me to call them back to give instruction they just sent it to a pick up location.  I ended up speaking to a supervisor who basically said that the many times I have had things delivered it was probably because my home is just outside of the area that they service and that driver was just being nice and drove the extra 1 km or whatever to deliver it to me, but the other times the driver didn't because he didn't technically have to. That just seems insane to me that this is what I am being told by a supervisor! It is basically a toss of the coin whether I will receive a package shipped by them.

2965,Valentina Lozanova,"B-day package not delivered on time due to mechanical delayPuro-(very much)later..... that's what I got when I sent a package from Toronto to Mont-Tremblant with Purolator. The package was to be delivered for my daughter on her 18th birth-day in the summer camp near Mont-Tremblant. The package delivery was delayed to to""Mechanical delay - late trailer"". When I called the customer service they couldn't even tell me where exactly the package was, they also had no clue where was the truck which carried my package. The package will be delivered but it is not going to be on my daughter's birth-day as it was intended, it might be a day or two or three later, who knows.... because the Puro-much-later or may be never had no clue of where exactly the truck was with my package. And what recourse is available to me in this situation - FAT NOTHING! The package will be delivered, but my daughter's birth-day will be over, her favorite fruits that were put in the package, counting on the timely delivery, will most likely rote and spill over the precious mementos that were sent in the same package. Thank you Purolator for making my daughter b-day a very special day!!!Date of experience: July 24, 2019"

So he delivered my package to the hospital, miles and miles away, go figure. After tracking my package to a wrong or bad address and calling purolator, I was told they delivered it to the hospital, not to worry, the hospital was as dumbfounded as I was.Skip ahead to today, has to be the same driver, bad address, non deliverable! What the F&%!, how can these people get jobs delivering if they can't read. I was home the whole day, not a single purolator truck came by slow or otherwise. Should I expect my package to go to the hospital again? Do you hire folks that are blind? how about can't read?

2968,Curt Petrovich,"Purolator lies and misleadsPurolator lies. It’s really that simple. I’ve been waiting since last week for two items that are allegedly “out for delivery” only to mysteriously flip into “delayed due to external factors”, several days in a row. Before the vague, and ridiculous “external factors” lie, it was “severe weather or natural disaster”.  It might have rained a bit one day more than a week ago. I’m not entirely sure because if it did, it was...well, rain. We’ve had no earthquakes, volcanoes, civil war or alien invasions. That I know of. So, external factors sound pretty much like the driver was either overworked or too damn lazy to drive to my house. My house being a 30 minute drive from the Amazon fulfilment centre where one of the items was handed over to Purolator. My complaints to Amazon came with my patronage of some years as a subscription customer as well as someone who regularly buys several items a month.  This isn’t the first time Purolator has either been guilty of gross incompetence or outright fraud by lying to Amazon and the customer. I’m having a call with a senior rep at Amazon HQ after writing to Jeff Bezos about Purolator’s shameful business practices.Date of experience: July 23, 2019"

I was right!If you've read any of the reviews here then you'll appreciate me keeping this to bullet-points. Here's the highlights:• No delivery--4 days past the stated date• Confusing and vague reasons given for delay• False information given by 'help' service• Broken 2nd promise for rescheduled delivery...I'm waiting for them to put the final classic Purolator touch on this fiasco by putting that stupid notice on my door saying that they tried to deliver--EVEN THOUGH I WAS HOME FROM WORK, WAITING FOR THEM. (This has happened several times; it seems to be their favourite move.)If you have a choice (I didn't), AVOID AT ALL COST.

I checked back a few times and by midday, Purolator had set the status to ""The shipment is delayed due to delay in transit."". What does that mean?I sent them a service ticket. They did not respond. I tried live chat and ""Meghan B."" told me rather bluntly to look at the tracking again the next day after 10am.Getting the feeling I wasn't being given good service, I called Purolator.They finally told me they were too busy to deliver my parcel and had received many missed deliveries in my area? They went on to say the chat agent should have never told me what she did and promised to look into it.Amazon meanwhile told me they gave Purolator an instruction to immediately deliver the parcel, but I never did see Purolator that day. I've now asked Amazon to cancel the order.I don't mind delays. But Purolator is useless. I rarely use such a strong description of a company, but Purolator frequently misses my deliveries and their tracking system would be better turned off because it is totally inaccurate and the descriptions they use mean nothing.Wake up Purolator. You're not too big to fail. I for one will ask every company I order from to not use Purolator for my orders.Mistakes are understandable.

I highly encourage those considering using Purolator to choose other companies like FedEx or UPS.  I recently decided to give Purolator another try for my most recent order which turned out to be a huge mistake. I originally had a one-day shipping option selected which cost me quite a bit, but I agreed to use it since I desperately wanted my item delivered as soon as possible. Sadly, the promised delivery date came and left, and the item arrived late and damaged. The damage was light but coupled with the lateness made the whole experience an absolute nightmare.  During the day that It was originally supposed to arrive I kept checking the status of the delivery which still showed the promised delivery date and only updated late in the evening well past the delivery window despite the delay being recorded on their side several hours prior. This withholding of information is truly abhorrent. Once I found out about the delay I spoke to an agent to ask about a refund on the shipping and they refused to refund the shipping cost despite them not honoring the promised delivery time.Being denied the refund was a complete slap to the face because I had paid extra  to ensure it would arrive at the original promised time. Overall my experience has been absolutely horrible, and I encourage anyone considering using Purolator to reevaluate and chose another company if you value transparency, punctuality, good customer service and not receiving your packages damaged.Date of experience: July 18, 2019"

It said : ""Delivery could not be made, appointment necessary""Can you imagine ? The package was literally in front of my house, but the driver did not dare get out of his truck to see if someone was here (even though there was clearly someone, I even made eye contact with the driver from my window) instead, he just took the package back to the warehouse to THEN schedule a pickup / appointment.This is baffling.

I have been living at the same address for 3 years now, my street is a big street in Montreal-North, as soon as you type my address on Google it comes up with clear instructions and mind you, my duplex is the 4th building in that street so very easy to notice and find. In 3 years I have NEVER had any issues with deliveries (From Amazon or any other company) I have always received my packages on time at my door but NOT TODAY!!! for the first time Amazon used Purolator to deliver my package and Surprise Surprise I didn't receive it cause apparently they couldn't find my address, I called customer service a 1h30 pm to explain that I had a message from Amazon saying their driver could not find my address and I also explained that I really needed the package for my son, the representative checked my address on her map and SURPRISE, SHE FOUND IT EASILY AND MY HOUSE IS 15 MINUTES FROM WHERE THE STORE IS LOCATED. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with her, she tried to talk to a bunch of other departments but they never got a hold on the drive, she said she was going to send him a message and a copy of the itinerary and also a message the explain the urgency of my package but that all she could do. So now the day is ending, I haven't received the package and I am gonna have to wait until Tuesday to get a delivery or go pick it up at their store since this is a long weekend in Montreal. It's really frustrating and I am going to find a way to get Amazon to NEVER deliver my packages through that company ever again.Date of experience: June 22, 2019"

3011,Scott,"Can’t handle deliveries in urban areasEdit: Good news. Amazon was able to blacklist Purolator for all my deliveries. It took 5 minutes via the chat support.Purolator is a real joke in urban areas. They don’t do any effort to deliver the package and they won’t leave the package at the door. Even if you ask them too. Even if Amazon ask them too. After only one try, they leave the package that’s an HOUR away by car, even more by transit.I live in Downtown Montreal and they want me to go all the way to LACHINE to get a 10$ item. Every other courrier manage to get it right and find a way to leave the package in a safe place.If Purolator can’t handle residential deliveries in an intelligent way, they should stop doing them. If Amazon keeps using Purolator for urban deliveries I will cancel my Prime membership because its more a pain then anything else.Reply to the social media team: Why won’t you leave it in a depot that’s near my place in the first place??? Also, its a HOME delivery service, not a go to the store to get your package service.. I looked up other shipping company on Trustpilot. Of course, people come here to complain, but of all the shipping companies, none have a 94% 1 star rating. Something is wrong with this company.Date of experience: June 21, 2019"

Yes, they deserve it.I bought a globe from amazon and worth 100 dollars , the tracking shows that the package was shipped to my door but I did not get anything, even though I stayed at home everyday with my three kids. I call the purolator and they say they can not do anything since the gps showed the package has been delivered. How can this happen? You can throw my package anywhere and tell me it was delivered. What your company’s responsibility? Take the packages and collect money and throw them in the garbage can then all job doneDate of experience: June 21, 2019"
3013,Shiena,"Lazy delivery guysI am writing to inform you that I am very disappointed with your company's delivery person in my area. Many times I have ordered items online and they come to me perfectly BUT they are delivered by a different carrier. When your company delivers it they never properly do it. One recent occasion was a package I ordered from Amazon. It was meant to be a same-day delivery due to the fact that I am back to work the next day. I always check the tracking status to make sure to expect them. At 7:11 pm I check the status again to find out they “attempted” a delivery. Which I call this bull. Now to support my case I took pictures as well and if you require so I’m more than happy to send it to you. Why I call this as such is because no attempts were made to call through the intercom. Again, I can show you the list of calls I received from my phone and not came through my intercom. I go out of my building to find a slip attached on the front of the building as I live in an apartment. Now if they look at the intercom it says to dial the apartment # to contact the tenants of that building. My apartment number is written on my address. Therefore, this tells me that they had no excuse to just put the slip in front of the building door. This tells me that they didn’t bother at all. And now I have to go to one of the pick-up locations to pick up the item. I would’ve left it at that BUT their location is open Mon-Fri 9am-7pm Sat&Sun 9am-5pm. Well, guess what, I am now back to work for the next five days. And I work 9-5pm every day and traveling to the downtown city for an hr each way. I work as a manager in the hospitality industry and therefore I don’t go home exactly at 5 pm. So, what exactly will happen to my package then? Returned to the seller right. More headaches and more pain for a simple package that was supposed to have been delivered if and was delivered properly. Now why I am writing this letter? Because I am done taking this kind of bull from your company. I can’t always choose the carriers the company I buy from therefore you as a company needs to address this issue with whoever delivers your packages. This has happened so many times that its so frustrating because most time that I get something delivered I get it so I have the day off which works wonders for other carriers but seem to not work with Purolator because again they just put a slip on the front of your door and calls it “attempted” delivery. For a company that has the word “Promises Delivered” to their website and ads is false advertising. If not taken seriously then you as a company is a failure. I tell this to all my friends and contact and to ensure not to use your company as a carrier. Even the property I work for no longer uses Purolator. I have Amazon and Sephora ensure that when I order items from them that they will not use Purolator as a choice in delivering my items but again I can’t always choose what others will use. I hope that you take this seriously and that to address such issues with your deliveries. I would like the person who delivers to my area as well be put responsible for his actions. I am more than happy to provide you with the information of you require to find out who that person is. Again, if you’d like pictures I will happily send them to support my case. Thank you and you have a good day.Date of experience: June 21, 2019"

3023,Angelica ,"I made a complaint about Purolator last…I made a complaint about Purolator last month, about a late and then missed delivery to my home. I have spent weeks trying to get an answer from them. Tracking says they tried to deliver an already late package at 3am and at 6 am (which are ridiculous times!) but I was home and didn't receive anything, not a call, email or even a missed delivery card. I got an automated call at 9am saying my package was already at the depot. All I'm asking is - why would you try to deliver at 3 or 6 am? Were you even at my house? I don't think they even tried to deliver and just dropped it off at the depot, expecting me to pick it up. This company's customer service is terrible. They will respond to you here, but when you try to talk to them about your complaint, they do not respond. Wish I could give them zero stars.UPDATE: This is to respond to the social media response below. None of the answers I have received from the three different people in your company (including 'local management') have been able to answer why someone who was home, waiting for a late package would not have heard a knock, a buzz, phone call or text to let them know the driver was here. If you had really tried to deliver, I would have happily received it. So to be clear, the 'information I want from you' is whether you were really here at all, or if your company was trying to save time by just directing me to the depot to pick up my own package. I hope Amazon stops using you, and your company customer service is a joke. Thanks for nothing!Date of experience: June 11, 2019"
3024,JAMES PETTITT,"AGAIN Purolator has made a fool of meAGAIN Purolator has made a fool of me.  Last year they failed to drop off a lovely gift from James Robison Ministries, failed four times.  Their excuses were many and I swore never to use them again (I never did get my book).  This year I p/u a new TV from Best Buy and it came in less than a week, as promised.  Trouble is by the time I walked from my bedroom to the front door they were gone.  I'm in my 70s and don't move swiftly anymore.  My daughter took me to Purolator's location in my City's south end to pick up the TV.  NEVER will I buy anything from anyone if requiring delivery by Purolator.  I will pay more (if I must) to hire another service.  And, NO, they do not phone you if your doorbell does not get you to your door fast enough.

For some reason they don't equip their drivers with phones to call me when they are at my location, and I randomly get a notification saying I couldn't answer the door. I will make a negative review everytime they deliver my package.Before one of your worthless social media representatives answer my post asking for my reference number, I've been through this process before, you aren't able to offer any useful solution. My only demand is for the delivery driver to call me when they arrive at my apartment, this is something your worthless company is too cheap to do, or at least leave it at a location close to me not 1 hour away.

3043,Natasha Ho,"Left a notice saying they didn't have an access code when they are all available at the front.Editing my review to make the timeline easier to read rather than a block of text.--Monday, May 27: I waited home all day because their delivery timeframe was 8am-8pm. No one showed up. I checked tracking, it was out for delivery at 8am, and at 6pm they marked it as ""Delivery Rescheduled for Next Business Day"".I called customer service and they said the delivery driver couldn't meet their quota for the day due to external factors. That's a little annoying but understandable.Tuesday, May 28: I wait at home all day again and when I checked tracking, I noticed that at 3pm, they left a note online saying ""Address correction required - no entry code."" We have an intercom at our apartment gate and no one's had an issue buzzing us before. We've had Amazon delivery, Canada Post, UPS, and food delivery all able to access us.On top of that, there was a paper notice also from Purolator for another tenant's missed package - leading me to think that they hadn't attempted to even use the codes at the front for either deliveries.Tuesday, May 28, Evening: I called customer services again, and they've left a note for the delivery driver with our buzzer code (which we've never had to do with any other delivery service before), and they've rescheduled the delivery for Thursday (May 30)Wednesday, May 29, Midnight: I checked my tracking at night and noticed that it said ""May 28, 2019 / 10:42 p.m. / Vancouver, BCShipment scheduled for delivery next business day"" - which would be today (Wednesday) and not Thursday. I contacted live chat to confirm the date and they mentioned it was an automated message and delivery will indeed be attempted on Thursday.Wednesday, May 29, Afternoon: I checked tracking at 8am it was updated to read ""On vehicle for delivery"" and another live chat representative said that it will be out for delivery today (Wednesday) and if failed, will be reattempted tomorrow (Thursday). A representative reached out and asked if I would be home. I told them I would be.Wednesday, May 29, Evening: Tracking has been updated at 6pm stating ""Delivery rescheduled for the next business day"".Thursday, May 30: Package finally arrived after I've had to contact Purolator four or five times to get everything sorted out.This is four days now that I have had to clear from my schedule to wait for a delivery.I'm unsure if I simply got a delivery driver who doesn't care, or if the company is severely under staffed (due to the driver not being able to meet all this deliveries the first day, and then not having the time or patience to buzz my apartment).It seems no one really knows what's going on either and everything's a bit of a mess. The only upside to all of this is that at least the customer service representatives are patient and kind. Unfortunately the delivery services of this delivery company is severely lacking.--I have had problems with Purolator in the year as well where I've had to go and pick up a missed delivery which I know for a fact that I did not miss. I had been home all day as I was expecting a delivery. The intercom buzzer is connected to ring my cellphone and I had no missed calls from the buzzer that day either if I had just not heard it.--Overall, I would not recommend their delivery services to anyone. I have contacted Amazon and asked them to use any other delivery service available whenever possible, and will be telling friends and family to avoid them as well.I am very put off by this company and disappointed in their services.Date of experience: May 29, 2019"

I feel I pay for premium just in vain when I need to wait for so long, even now am not sure I will ever get the delivery. Amazon should really think about a good transporter for its customer, Purolator is one of the worst delivery service ever.Date of experience: May 27, 2019"
3048,Ashley,"Paid extra for one day shippingPaid extra for one day shipping, when the package didn’t arrive I called and they told me they couldn’t get into my building. They never left a notice and never sent an email. I asked if next time they could just leave the package at my door, or call me to come down and open the building door (the access code machine is broken). They said of course and that it would be delivered the next day. I waited another day and called again and was told they can NEVER leave a package at the door and they can NEVER phone a customer when they arrive. SO long story short, it’s 4 days later and I still don’t have my package. I called again today and was told I’m going to have to pick it up from the nearest phacility (30 min away).  Very unimpressed and was never even offered a refund for shipping costs or anything. Terrible customer service.Date of experience: May 27, 2019"
3049,Maja Jankovic,"Service not reliableI ordered my package, via next day delivery from Amazon and it arrived 4 days later. The reason why it was not delivered was because they could not find my house (only purolator had this problem so far). Instead of calling me or leaving a note I had to call the hotline and they were not able to deliver the package the next day, we had to wait in total 4 days to be able to pick up the package, which was kind of urgent. really bad service, not reliable.Date of experience: May 27, 2019"

3051,Katrina,"Horrible customer service, terrible internal communication, and inconsiderate driversI wish I could leave zero stars. I'm appalled at the service I just received from Purolator. For one, I got one package immediately sent back to the seller due to ""No access"". I was confused and didn't think to follow up, as it was just one item I could live without for the time being. But my next delivery is what really set me off, as I was waiting on multiple items: They attempted delivery on Wednesday while I was out, and they left no paper notice--and I live in a condo building, where normally, Post Canada will ring someone else's doorbell just to gain access to the building, and then leave it in front of my condo door. The following day, delivery was scheduled to be ""attempted"" again, and so I waited all day long--these were essential items, and I did not want to miss out again on the delivery. I called the call centre, and they couldn't give me an estimated delivery time because they have no contact with the driver. I STRONGLY urge Purolator to improve this, as it is extremely inconvenient and inconsiderate to customers, who cannot afford to wait around all day for a package, nor miss out on it day after day. Also, when I tracked the package, it said that ""the driver contacted me to reschedule delivery"", which they certainly hadn't. I called customer service at 6:30 p.m., and they told me that it was an access problem again. I realized it was because I live off St-Catherine E, which is closed for pedestrians all summer long (every year)--so instead of finding another route, Purolator decided to turn around and NOT deliver my package TWICE. Meanwhile, I had gotten a Canada Post delivery, no problem, that same day. There are three other routes available to get to my place, but Purolator didn't care at all to find them. So, after three calls to Purolator customer service (and each time, the person was shockingly unfriendly), they finally managed to put a note somewhere in their broken system to take another street to my condo.The cherry on top was when I finally received the delivery today (two days later)--I buzzed them into the building and waited, but they never came to my door. I went downstairs to the building's main entrance, and the driver had merely left my packages there, unattended. EXTREMELY unprofessional. This is a very unreliable company who needs improvement in all areas of their service.Date of experience: May 24, 2019"
3052,Renata Steele,"Absolutely awful serviceAbsolutely awful service! They did not deliver my package yesterday like I was promised. I waited on hold for a long time to confirm that they had the write address for delivery. The first lady I spoke with said that she guarantees that the driver went inside the business that was listed on the package and that no one knew who I was, she was extremely unfriendly on the phone and said that the driver would get there today. I called the business and they guaranteed me that no one came there with a package yesterday. I called back again to make sure they had the right address after waiting on hold again for a long time. I was told that the driving did not go into the business because even though it was the right address on the package it was under my name not the business name so the driver didn't go in or bother to call me or the office to verify the address. I gave them the company name and confirmed the address. Then I was put on hold for a long time again. When the lady came back on the phone I asked for the manager, which took a long time to be connected. Mark Groundwater didn't apologize at all! He said the driver was falling the rules and that it was my problem that the package wasn't delivered and that I am not their only customer! I don't think I have ever spoken with a more unfriendly company who truly does not care about their clients. I don't recommend that anyone use their service!Date of experience: May 24, 2019"

Today I called, they said one is on trunck being delivered, unable to provide exact timing STILL, the other one has packaging issue, can only be sent out on next Monday! (I dont understand how it could happen at the first place!) So another week of waiting and tracking ahead now! Note that I was expecting it from END OF APRIL (almost a month ago)! It was returned because they could not find my address. So the sender (an hour away from my place) resent them last Friday. Until now, a week later, I still not able to receive them and expected to wait longer! I wanted to know where the shipment is, so I dont have to keep waiting. Guess what, in this 21st century, drivers dont have a phone, no GPS on the truck, and they can't locate the distance, the waiting window is basically WHOLE DAY! All they could advise is to put a note on the door (HAS TO BE ON THE DOOR), to let them drop the shipments without my present.

After getting home at 7:10pm i message again as i got no call and they respond they will call when they have a chance to.

3057,Thaidra Leigh,"Unacceptable serviceUnacceptable service. I receive medication via courier that requires temperature control to stabilize, which is why it is sent at a premium cost from the shipper to ensure delivery on a specific day BEFORE 12pm. This also requires me to stay home until the delivery is received. The driver did not even attempt to make a delivery (I have live feed cameras). Using the tracking number discovered that it had been ""rescheduled for the next day"" due to non delivery. When the shipper called to inquire was informed that the driver did not make the cutoff time as so it was rerouted to a next day delivery. Neither myself nor the shipper was notified.

They don't call on arrival, so if you live in an apartment as I do, you're out of luck. I just ordered a package earlier this week and it was scheduled for delivery, knowing it was by a garbage company like purolator that doesn't call on arrival the only way for me to get my package was to wait in the lobby for the delivery truck to appear, I started my watch at 9:30 am and my tracking information said the package will arrive by 9:00 pm, so there a 12 hour period where your package can come at any time with no email notification except them emailing you and saying ""Sorry we missed you. Purolator tried to deliver your package today but didn't want to leave it unattended.""Please look for a notice of attempted delivery or contact Purolator for the next steps."" Anyways I was sitting in the lobby watching youtube on my phone it had been around 3 hours, I had a clear view of the street and front door, for 3 hours I sat there and waited for my package, for 3 hours I watched cars go by, until I saw a purolator truck speed by, the only purolator truck that had passed my building in 3 hours, then I get an email saying there was an attempted delivery. Absolute trash service, I immediately called purolator and gave them my tracking number, and they kept cutting me off while I as trying to explain the situation with ""Is there a buzzer? does the driver need a pass code to get in? Do you want to reschedule for delivery?"" and more stupid questions that if the driver even attempted to deliver my package, he would have found these out. For the record, my building is open to the public until 7 pm then you need a key card, the driver didn't even slow down, he just passed by. Literally minutes after the ""attempted delivery"" I called and asked for a reschedule and the earliest they can reschedule is tomorrow, the driver is at most 5 minutes away from when I called. 1 star is still too generous for this absolute joke of a company, laziest drivers I've ever seen, I pray to all the gods to end this company and their antiquated non call on arrival, pass my building without even stopping, cut me off while im trying to calmly explain the situation with DO YOU WANT YOUR PACKAGE DELIVERED?

Since they send no statement I wait for a few invoices before paying.

The customer had access to tracking id from the sending party, checks purolator website and tracks that package and it displays status as ""On vehicle for delivery"". After 6 hours, the customer takes a step further and reaches out to live human agent  and gets response the ""delivery is yet to be made"" for a package is already dropped in shipping partner location.

It is so absolutely frustrating because the end result for me is having to drive half an hour away to 800 Kipling to pick up my package and then half an hour back home all because they can't be bothered to even attempt to see if somebody's home. When I called Purolator to find out the whereabouts of my package as well as inform them about this issue I've been consistently having with them over the years, I was told they were going to log a complaint against this particular driver. In my opinion that's not going to solve anything. All that will do is hurt this one person and possibly even put his or her job in jeopardy, that's not what I want nor does it solve the issue. If this is happening with all the drivers consistently across the board then clearly there is an issue during training or they are hiring people who just don't care. Purolator needs to take responsibility and take action to correct these issues because it is evident that I'm not the only one having them and punishing one single driver isn't going to fix their reputation. At this rate, Purolator may as well cut their costs and not have drivers at all, just make it a storage facility where customers can come pick up their packages since we've already been doing so for years.Date of experience: April 11, 2019"

3099,Soren,"Bad bad bad bad HORRIBLE CompanyI want to start off by saying Purolator is not a shipping company. They probably want you to think that. They try to act like it. But they aren't.You see, this company doesn't understand what it means to be a shipping company. Cause you know, delivering things and being convenient are kind of what makes a shipping company a shipping company. My roommate and  I, work opposing hours. There is only a small time frame where no one is home. And they constantly deliver at this time. Its a time where no one would usually even be home. On top of this constant worst timing, they only try once. You'd think; ""well okay, at least I can go pick it up at the postal office."" Nope. They're special. You have to go to their incredibly far and inconvenient warehouse to pick it up. For where I am, the warehouse is in the middle of this industrial area with almost nothing around it. Walking there is almost impossible as you only have a road that stretches for a good twenty minutes. In the winter its especially bad as this road is barely taken care of, and you can't walk beside this narrow road as the snow is near 3-4 feet deep. So if you don't have a car like me, you can almost get hit just trying to get there. Even worse you need to walk through this overpass that only has just enough room to let a car get through. After picking up my package, I decided I didn't want to do that horrible walk again, so I called a taxi. Well actually, I called about 5 of them. They all refused to come to that area. I couldn't even get an Uber. And the closest bus was 25 minutes away down the same dangerous road. Unfortunately for me, I don't have a car, which is why i buy things online. Generally, big and heavy things that I can't carry with me. So this completely defeats the purpose of getting anything online. It defeats the purpose to even pay for shipping. So to me, this company isn't a shipping related one. Its a horrible warehouse. You CAN call them to redeliver, which I have started to do. They won't unless you call them and ask politely though... However,  they can still deliver at that horrible little time frame. Which they usually do. In addition, every time I have asked for them to redeliver, my items have generally arrived damaged.So my message to this company, please stop existing or do what you're supposed to. I shouldn't need to have a car to pick up what YOU were supposed to deliver to my door. My message to anyone who has to deal with them, good luck. I wish you the best.Date of experience: April 09, 2019"

3118,Yaman Asaf,"packages never delivered, thrown in garbage and call it deliveredI always order packages from Amazon, driver is too lazy to attempt delivery. They never deliver my packages, that's why most of orders gets returned back to Amazon, it's a huge loss for the company.  if Amazon doesn't get rid of this company, they will loose revenue big time.  I live in an apartment on the third floor, so instead of delivering my package to my apartment, the  delivery person leaves the package outside on the street at building main door and update status as delivered; my package was stolen. I live in neighborhood where you have too many homeless and thieves.  I called customer service and she was rude to me.  I asked to file a complain about the person who never attempt delivery, and she told me that I am wrong, the delivery person is doing his job, and he didn't do anything wrong. She said Purolator doesn't have to knock on door or deliver to apartment, they can just leave it outside the building main door if signature is not required. I understand that most couriers like Canadapost can deliver to safe location if you live in a house and you can choose to have them not deliver to safe location regardless if signature required or not however Purolator does not operate that way. Most shipping companies will never leave packages in hallway of apartment building, you can't treat apartments like houses, it's against fire safety code to leave packages in hallway, so customer service rep need to be educated about that because today she was arguing with me that they can leave packages wherever they want.  Also apartment buildings are not considered safe locations, so you should not treat it like a house and you should not leave packages anywhere in public view because packages are visible to anyone accessing the building, and can be stolen. Purolator workers are negligent, ignorant and rude. whether your customers live in apartment or house, they will just throw packages in unsafe locations and not attempt any delivery, then they will lie to you and tell you they attempted delivery, and if there is no signature required, they act like they are not responsible, they may as well throw your package in the garbage bin, and call it delivered.  I advise any company that if you don't want to loose any customers or loose money on lost items or returned items, avoid this scam company, even they may have better deals or cheaper rates than other companies, in the long term, you will end up loosing more money because of the unprofessional service.Date of experience: March 22, 2019"

First time said road condition was bad, the entrance of the building was blocked or even a deer died on the road, while we live in the city near a busy Main Street! We could even look out the window and the road was clear! Second time said no one home while we were home and we even left a note for the delivery driver in the building entrance said please buzz this code so we can come out, they didn’t even try to deliver our package, just said no one home and didn’t even leave a notice. Third time said the delivery person wasn’t familiar with our building location so he couldn’t deliver. And now after many lessons from them, I found out my recent package is still being delivered by purolator, I contacted them in the afternoon and they said they will try to deliver to us today, if they miss us they will send my package to the main center so we can pick it up ourselves tomorrow instead of waiting till Monday. Then I checked after I finished work, I saw that purolator stated attempted to deliver but no one home, and no indication where the package went. So I called again in the late afternoon and the customer service gave me a confirmation number and stated that the package will be at the main center for pickup. And now guess what? The website of purolator said they will attempt to deliver on Monday. Spoke to two customer services and have a confirmation number, they still do their own thing. Totally ignore what the customer requested. I recently found out that I can choose to send my package to an Amazon pickup point, I just choose that option because I don’t want to waste my time with this company.

3133,HJ,"Unbelievable !!!!Unbelievable !!!!Not even they do not deliver the goods to you they now have a practice not to even leave the delivery notice on your mailbox if you live in a condominium building.Whatever is shipped to us via Purolator is being returned to the sender because we are not even informed that the goods are being held for us at their counter. I tried to complain but the response was :""Because there is personal information that would be placed on a delivery notification, our drivers are not required to leave a notice of delivery attempt at a multiple unit location......At this point, we have provided sufficient information on our delivery  practices and means of tracking shipments.""How rude is that ???!!!Date of experience: March 07, 2019"

3138,Chris,"Bad delivery and deliverymenI ordered things from amazon twice the past 2 weeks. Both times Amazon chose this Purolator to deliver my items. Both ended up with huge dissatisfaction. Both incidents were identical. Let me do the run down:1) Purolator delivery man arrived at my building not able to get into the building for whatever reasons. He did not attempt to look for my buzz code even though my buzz code can be found on the dashboard with my name on it. I was home waiting for the delivery2) Delivery man left, did not put up any slips or anything3) Next day, I check my order detail on amazon, and went into the tracking, and found out that the deliveryman claimed that my address was incorrect and not able to deliver my items.4) I called purolator, the nice customer service agent name Roger answer and explained to me that because I did not put my buzz code in my address when making the delivery, deliveryman wasnt able to get in. I ask him why other companies like Fedex UPS DHL USPS CanadaPost all somehow found a way to get in, but why not Purolator. He couldnt answer.5) The deliveryman simply did not bother enough to deliver my items, and tried hard to find ways not to deliver the items to me.6) He did not leave a slip or whatever.7) I asked the customer service agent if he could find put what time will the delivery occur the next day, he couldnt advise as deliveryman has tons of delivery to do. And the next option is to leave it to the purolator office which is a mile away in downtown which defeats the purpose of delivery. He couldnt advise more. I know this agent tried his best but he simply couldnt. And this item for some reason must have my signature to deliver, and for god sake its just essential oils and protein powder inside whats the big deal? 8) So now I have to stay home and wait for the delivery to come to me all day for the next few days until I receive it, because nobody knows when it will arrive to my place, when or what time.This same ordeal happened twice and in the exact same fashion. It would be a problem solve if purolator can just adhere tot he delivery date which appear in the tracking, and have the deliveryman to look for the buzz code if not find a way to get into the building just like how Fedex UPS DHL USPS Canada post all have been doing. If not have more purolator offices in urban area based on population density and deliver the items there.From now on, whenever I am have something delivered to me, I will call the merchant to NOT USE PUROLATOR!! Seriously, your delivery method and deliverymen (Plural) failed your company. If you cannot be on par with UPS DHL FEDEX USPS CANADAPOST then dont run a delivery business. I am so frustrated to even need to write here and having to call the customer service twice. Also there were no emails or notice from Purolator that my delivery encountered any delivery failure, not at all. If i didnt go to amazon, i wouldnt have known. And you can bet that I will go the great distance to ask my merchants to NOT using Purolator.If you are a customer service agent reading this, I want you to know that you are doing a great job trying to resolve all problems, but it is delivery approach which is wrong and undermining the company.Date of experience: March 05, 2019"
3139,customer,"CLOWNS!!!!!I get parcels from these guy's through Amazon.I was suppose to get a parcel March 4th,2019 (the delivery date) and nothing. I waited all day for this parcel, come to find out the carrier was here and gone. This isn't the first time this as happened. Around 11AM my phone rang to the intercom, after 2 rings I answer it and say hello 3 times louder everytime...no reply...NOTHING..so did he just push the button and leave?? When I looked at the status of my parcel it said had wrong address..I never changed my address on Amazon for a few years now. When I called Purlator, they informed me the carrier tried to deliver at 6:10AM.(Riiiight) I never in my life received a delivery that early. I also didn't recieved a call on my intercom either because I would have heard it. The lady then asked me for my address. When I told her my buzzer number she said, Oh.I'll put that in there. I was like, what do you mean?? It never changed!!! SERIOUSLY? I know for a fact they had my buzzer because I HAD THIS ISSUE BEFORE WITH THEM. I KNOW FOR A FACT THEY HAD THE CORRECT INFORMATION. SO FRUSTRATED. If I had a choice I would never use Purlator. Not only do they lie to you and make it out to be your fault the parcel wasn't delivered, but the delivery guys are rude. They give no eye contact, no smile...NOTHING even if you say, Thank You! They just hand you the parcel and leave and walk away. They also stopped leaving missed delivery papers. How are you supposed to know if your parcel arrived? What if you didn't have a tracking number. The reason being, they don't want someone else stealing your package and have your information. DON'T PUT PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THERE THEN. Canada Post don't have any issues. 1 excuse after another. It wouldn't surprise me if this carrier is next to be shut down.

3149,Tori Hillier,"The level of incompetency of Purolator…The level of incompetency of Purolator is completely indescribable. I had paid $150 to have a birth certificate expedited as it was crucial for a flight I had booked. The government office in Ontario did their due diligence but unfortunately as soon as it got into Purolators hands, that was not the case any longer. Even though my package was in Calgary on February 11, I did not receive any notice or phone call that something was wrong with my address until the evening of February 14. They had left a message explaining they were unable to deliver it because my apartment number wasn’t on it and to give them a call back. I called back within ten minutes with my tracking number and explained the situation only to be told that it was too late and it was going to be sent back to Ontario and there was nothing I could do. Feeling frustrated yet still optimistic, I called again on Friday morning and re explained my story to a women who seemed genuinely concerned for the whereabouts of my birth certificate. After a timely hold, I was informed that she was unable to intercept them sending it back as it left on the transport vehicle the previous night. Tuesday rolls around and I’ve heard nothing as well as my tracking number hadn’t been updated since the previous Thursday. I then call Ontario to ask if they’ve received it and low and behold they had not and convinced me this package was still likely in Calgary despite what I was told from multiple people. Upon contacting Purolator for a third time, I was then essentially told that they really didn’t know where it was but would get a “trace specialist” on it right away as I needed it to travel. About an hour later I get a call from this said specialist who is extremely short with me and really only tells me that it got sent back and that Purolator simply “forgot” to update the tracking number. When I told him that Ontario did not in-fact receive it yet, he agreed it was “weird” because it should have been sent via express. Feeling very discouraged, I then went and cancelled my flights that were not refundable or transferable totally $300. After a very emotional day, I decided to try and call the depot here in Calgary just for a peace of mind that this important and legal document had not been lost or gotten into the wrong hands and what do you know.... they’ve had this package sitting there for a week... this is completely unacceptable customer service and I am now missing one of my longest friends birthdays due to your lack of competency. This morning I had to take a taxi (I don’t drive) to the depot to retrieve this package that cost me an additional $65!

Package has been assumed to be lost by Amazon. Not surprised at all, since the only two times (thank god) that Purolator has shipped my Amazon purchases, have resulted in failed deliveries, and missed deliveries (bullschitt, I was home the whole time, well-known fact that they don't actually attempt to deliver) with the recent one forcing me to call in to ask for the package to be moved within 50 km of me because Purolator thought it would be smart to move the package to a facility that would have required a 2 hour round trip by public transit or a 90 minute round trip by car. All that in mind, I live in Downtown Montreal, very close to the Purolator Downtown location. Purolator is a corrupt company, that is 91% owned by Canada Post, which in turn, is a crown Corporation, which is just another word for saying that it is owned by the Canadian government. It reeks of corruption and mismanagement.

They said it's ok, I shouldn't worry because the package would be there for pick up.So I hired a private delivery car to get the package with me. It turns out that, on Saturday, the package status changed from ""Ready for pick up"" to ""New schedule arranged"". Clearly someone forgot to inform the staff that I was going to be there on Saturday.Since I can't be the entire day available at home on Monday, I'll have to rehire the delivery car to get my package, because Purolator can't schedule a delivery in a specific time of the day nor weekends.I'm very disappointed with this first experience with them, and I also lost money because of that.Date of experience: February 09, 2019"

Yesterday I called someone at customer service and they told me that my package would be re delivered between 8am and 3pm so I got up at 8am and waited all day in the window for the truck to arrive, I was afraid they would show up when I wasnt watching and then leave .... but it is now 6:24pm, & I have NOT RECIEVED ANYTHING! I called customer service again and spoke to a very nice lady. She was helpful. Up until I was told that they would get in contact with the delivery agent but could not reach him. They told me they would try to contact him ASAP and find out where my package was and they would email me back... I didn’t receive any emails. And I just checked the Purolator tracking site and it says my order is ready for pick up... I PAID FOR DELIVERY. They DIDNT even ATTEMPT to re deliver it today... VERY disappointed and will NOT be using purolator again or ordering anything that ships by purolator.  EDIT: It is now the next day.... I couldn’t wait 24 to post another review so here’s what they decided to do... they emailed me and decided to CLOSE THE CASE. Are you f**cking kidding me? I was told that they were going to re deliver it but they didn’t even attempt to!!! I specifically PAID for two day shipping and all I get is one attempt and then a lousy email?

It's been a mess waiting for a delivery that I ordered on Sunday with one day shipping and it's almost Friday, yet to receive it. I have spent the week every morning on the phone with very professional and helpful attendants but their updates to my location, packing and such have remained not updated in the system, leading to delayed deliveries, failed attempts and so on. I have decided to pick up my package myself in Vaughn, probably going to spend money on a Lyft or on additional bus fare in the cold. I wouldn't mind if the package was left at my front door...Please can you devise a way for your drivers to communicate with people expecting deliveries because it's the 21 century. No way people dont have phones. All this could be avoided with a call that they are on their way to deliver.

3186,Mike Hawk,"Lacking Common Sense. Lazy, Lying Drivers. Phony ApologiesTo preface, I've used plenty of couriers. Mostly, I dealt with Canada Post, but occasionally FedEx and UPS. Never had a problem with any of them. I can think of two times Purolator has messed up badly. The first was regarding a medical cannabis delivery. Signature was required, but instead they left it outside. I guess our dog signed for it. Good move. This was before October 17th, making it an even juicier target for the druggies on our street, who broke into our car twice looking for pills. Switched to Canada Post after that, which was thankfully another option from my licensed producer.My more recent gripe is over an Amazon delivery. Like others who posted their stories, I never received a package that showed as delivered. Called useless customer care. Was told that you guys simply hide the packages if nobody's home. I was shocked, but having worked in a call centre, I didn't want to blow my top at the person speaking with me. I knew it wasn't her fault.It was Purolator's fault. I seriously have to ask, though, what kind of policy is it to leave packages outside? Other couriers put a note on the door. Then there's the issue of the delivery status. The girl on the phone put a trace on the package, but it came back that it was scanned and delivered. Obviously, that wasn't the case. Given the frequent theme in these reviews, I'm 99.9% certain that the driver was lying and simply didn't want to walk to our front porch. I'm not sure what motivates these people to be so lazy, but Purolator needs to scrap whatever policy compels the drivers to cut corners. Obviously there's a benefit to it for them. I remember reading this review about a person who missed their medication and was suffering severely for it thanks to a fake delivery. The response from ""James"" (or whoever) was appalling.""So sorry to hear about your experience, etc."". It was basically a carbon copy of the other ""apologies"" on here. How can you be so apathetic? This poor individual was suffering because of some driver who needed to rush his/her deliveries. Such a disingenuous apology. Shame on you. Absolutely selfish and disgusting. No accountability on any level.I don't really expect a resolution. They tried to find the package, but the driver's lies covered it up. Now I'm going to call up Amazon and get this sorted on their end. Thankfully it wasn't an expensive item.P.S. Trustpilot, please allow a zero stars option. Purolator makes it necessary.Date of experience: January 30, 2019"

For some time now, I've avoided deliveries sent by Purolator because I've almost never had anything delivered by Purolator ... each and every time, I end up walking to the Purolator office about 20 minutes away. If I wanted to walk 40 minutes for an item, I would simply go to the stores, wouldn't I? But ... I keep forgetting that Amazon sends some of its 2-day delivery parcels with Purolator. The last time it happened, I had to leave town after the scheduled delivery date so my parcel was returned. This time, I've received 4 or 5 messages saying my address is incomplete (it isn't) and therefore Purolator is ""having a problem delivering my parcel."" In the meantime, 2 other parcels from the same order have been delivered by different carriers. If this doesn't change, I'll cancel my Prime membership when it expires. In the meantime, I've stayed in for 3 days to make absolutely sure someone is at home for delivery. The problem, I'm guessing, is that the Purolator delivery person won't come to an apartment building without a buzzer number, even though our buzzer is the same as our apartment number and always has been. If this is a Purolator efficiency policy, it sucks.Date of experience: January 23, 2019"

Since then, I've contacted them every day view chat or facebook to change the delivery method to pickup for a downtown Toronto location. They've ignored every single one of the requests. Jan 10th they tried to deliver but I missed the buzzer due to work. Jan 11th they didn't buzz or leave a final attempt slip (very doubtful they even tried the last attempt). Come Jan 14th they give me an automated call telling me my package is available for pickup in ETOBICOKE.

After being on hold for over 20 minutes, I was told that she didn't know what happened and the package was at a Purolator office located over 30 mins from where I live.  There is one 5 mins, from me, so I asked why it would not be dropped off there.  It was a very non chalant and unapologetic response.Today, I drove over 30 mins in traffic to find out that the package was at the location 5 mins from my home.  I asked for a phone number to speak to someone to file a complaint.  Apparently, there isn't one, just the fantastic Customer Service line where they couldn't care less.I will continue to share my experiences, with companies like Amazon, as they show impressive customer service for things that aren't even their fault. They, also, may, eventually rethink their shipping choice.  Maybe Purolator will care more about the customers thenDate of experience: January 11, 2019"

3216,steve,"Purolator is not even a real courier.one star is like 1000 star too many. Purolator is the absolute worst courier service since the invention of mail. Somehow they managed to strike deals with online retailers so we have NO CHOICE when it comes to who deliver things to us. They probably achieved this by offering lowest rate, but this also mean they probably hire the least qualified staff and overload their infrastructure.  From repeated experience, it is clear that they rarely even attempt to make delivery at condos/apartments if they dont see buzz code. They rather make up BS on tracking ""attempted delivery - no answer"" and drop it off in a nearby depot (in the wilderness where they can afford space) for you to pick up.  customer service agents online or via phone also just repeat tracking info to you and say they will open a case and callback, which they never do.  one day or 2 day delivery is a MYTH with purolator. Canada Post on strike deliver regular parcel faster than Purolator's so called one day delivery within the same city. One day just means their driver mark down the parcel as delivered but it's clearly not going to show up for another few days. You can call customer service all you want but after 30 mins of wait they will just say ""but it says delivered... did you check the bushes?""Date of experience: January 10, 2019"

I'm glad to say that my faith has been restored with Purolator.  The problem stemmed from a change of the local Purolator depot - it hasn't been a seamless transition; consequently a lot of confusion has occurred.My only gripe now is that the information provided online; such as hours of operation for their dropoff/pickup locations, has not been reviewed for accuracy, obviously causing inconvenience to whoever is picking up or dropping off packages.Purolator used to be my courier of choice - now I'm going to steer clear.

They simply leave the package on the doorstep at disposal of anyone to steal. (I have actually had one of my packages stolen from this, might I add.)

I never gave my buzzer code to any carrier before and they still managed to get their delivery done. What made me mad is that they could have sent me an email regarding this issue. If I did not check on my package, I wouldn't know about it. And also, they gave me the tracking late as well so I could only see it until recently.Now, they expect me (a person with no car) to go travel for 1 hour to get my package at one of their pick up location. It'll be fine if I only got a light package. But now, I have to carry a 'printer' back home.Nice.

3259,Kirsten ,"Christmas package not deliveredMy parents sent out a Christmas parcel on December 10th from Ontario and it was to be shipped to me in Grande prairie. The tracking showed that is was in Edmonton on December 14th which is only 4 hours away. Now the tracking shows it is back in Ontario with no further updates. The customer service representatives give no true answer of where the package is. You would think when someone pays over 100$ in shipping the package would be delivered properly. Now there is no way this will get here for Christmas. I already am away from my family for Christmas and now I won’t even have their gifts to open.

I re-arranged my day to be able to be home to receive a package that was to be delivered today. It did not come, and when I checked for an update, the website said it's back at the sort facility because ""Receiver unavailable - shipment scheduled for delivery next business day"" - yet no one has been by at all. I tried to contact the company, but despite it being their LiveChat business hours, my LiveChat request was cancelled ""because no agents are available"" and getting through on the phone seems impossible.

And spoken to their ""Live Chat"" agents 3 times as well, all with guarantees of getting my TV to me ASAP. The TV was sent to my condo, but Purolator did not allow for it to be received by my concierge, despite having given them my explicit written consent to do so. Then it was sent to their holding facility over 40km away from where I live - I don't have a car, so requested to get it to a location closer to me. The location they tried was closer, only 15km away this time... After trying to deliver the package to this 'Purolator Partner center"" on Sunday, (when it was closed - genius), it was routed back to the original location 40km away. They didn't even attempt to ship it back to the closer location. When i spoke to them after an hour on the phone, they agreed to ship it back to the closer location, and guaranteed it would be there by Thursday December 13. Today when i received an email notification that said the package was delivered, I thought to myself, no way this company was stupid enough to have messed this up again... When i showed up to this Purolator partner pick up location today after work, my package was NOT there - turns out it was still in Etobicoke 40km away.If anyone has read through this whole post, just know that Canada Post could go on strike for a year and still be a better and more reliable shipping service than Purolator.

As according to my tracking information, my order should be somewhere on my property since they magically delivered it on Monday. I get it, the weather was atrocious on Monday.

3298,Petra Axolotl,"Driver Skipped DeliveryI ordered a TV from Amazon two weeks ago. It was one-day shipping but Purolator never picked it. A week after the original order, Amazon realized it's not going to happen and created a replacement order.This time the TV was picked up in Alberta and transported to Quebec. I check the status in the morning and it said ""On vehicle for delivery"". So I decided to stay at home to wait for it. Around 2pm, I checked the status again, and to my surprise, it became ""Shipment refused or could not be delivered"", although I had been waiting all the time.I called their customer service. After about one hour's waiting on the line, I explained the situation to their agent, who was not very surprised. She even said it's probably because the driver did not have time to deliver every package so he just drove back to the facility. Apparently it's a common practice with them.UPDATE: I talked to Purolator twice after the skipped delivery. Both times they promised it would be re-delivered the next day. And unsurprisingly, it did not happen. The third time when Amazon's representative called them, Purolator confirmed that it was already on its way back to Alberta. Amazon had to create a replacement, for a second time.SOLUTION: It is possible to ask Amazon's representative to add a note to a particular address that a carrier should be avoided.

Today is Dec 5th and nobody knows where the package is or when it will arrive.You will wait on the phone for 45 minutes for some rude person to tell you this. They suggest you use ""live chat"" to make it faster. Guess what? ""Live Chat"" is a no-show. Live Chat is about as fast as getting delivery from Purolator.

The update (via email) also indicated there would be a notice left on the door, but there was nothing there.  When I called customer service, I was on the phone waiting for at least 30 minutes only to be told that some sort of traffic in the City had hindered the driver from coming to my building (so no one actually physically even came to make a proper delivery attempt).  Ended up having to ask them to contact me when it arrives at their depot (an inconvenient distance from my apartment) since I didn't want to ""miss"" their ""attempted delivery"" again.

Wednesday morning I checked the tracking on my package and it says “in transit” and “estimated delivery time not available”. After multiple calls (holding for at least 50+ mins), Purolator still had no answers for me. Nobody can seem to give me any information as to where my package is! I feel that nobody in this company actually cares. I will note that the item I shipped is valued over $1600 and is time sensitive as I won’t qualify for a refund if it doesn’t reach its destination in the next 7 days. I would like to know who is going to pay for this? I’ve been given the run around all week and the emails I’ve received from so called customer service are short only stating we are working on your tracking your package. I will never trust Purolator in the future or use their “services”. I highly recommended that if you are considering Purolator that you look into using another company so you can avoid these headaches.

Worst company ever.Update: I've just tried calling them hoping it'd be faster. Since tomorrow is Sunday. I doubt that anyone will pick up.

I had to wait 4-6 mins between each response (for simple questions). Once she put in a request for pick up, she couldn't even answer a question about who can pick it up.

3324,Daniel Xia,"About a month of trouble and 10+ hours wastedQuite an unfortunate saga.  I ordered a 40 inch TV on Amazon.ca on November 23, 2018 that was supposed to be delivered by Purolator on November 26, 2018.  The order did not arrive, and at one point, was reported to be probably ""lost"" by Amazon.  Purolator's own web site changed the status to ""delivery date not available.""  I spent more than 10 hours trying to reach someone at Amazon or Purolator who can explain what the status of the delivery is.  Unfortunately, everyone I spoke with was unhelpful.  Eventually, a replacement order was placed via Amazon.ca on December 6, scheduled to arrive on  December 10.  The original TV then arrived (without any notification from Purolator) on December 8 (12 days late), and when I tried to cancel the replacement, I was told I couldn't; the replacement arrived on December 13 (3 days late).  The end result is that I had to spend additional time returning the replacement, which was received by Amazon on December 20.  Frankly, this sort of unreliable service is more of the rule rather than the exception for Purolator.  Unfortunately, this experience also means that I likely won't order any large items through Amazon again, until it is clear their delivery service is up to par.Date of experience: November 30, 2018"

I ordered something online a few days ago and without any prior notice, Purolator left a note on my apartment's door saying they had made a delivery attempt. First, the attempt was made at 10:38am. I can safely say that the majority of the Canadian 19+ population is either at work or at school at this time of the day. The fact that they only made ONE delivery attempt and asked me to pick it up myself at a warehouse 1.5 hr bus ride away from my apartment is beyond ridiculous. If I need to spend 3.0 hours on a bus just to pick up an item I bought online, I might as well have bought it in store. But fine, I get it. this is this company's shxtty policy. But couldn't the delivery man have at least notified me ahead of time so I could alternate arrangements? I received absolutely no texts, no calls, no emails. Absolutely nothing.I am a college student having classes from 8:30am-6pm on weekdays. It is just impossible for me to pick up the parcel myself during their business hours. And they only hold your stuff for 5 days too. Like the heck?! I guess Purolator is really nice to their employees. One delivery attempt per parcel and they can just chill at the office and wait for frantic customers to pick the parcels up themselves.

The first day they said the attempted delivery, but the address was wrong so they couldn't. When I went on the live chat tech support to make sure my address was correct they said it was, the driver must have made a mistake. Considering I was home all day it doesn't seem like the delivery even attempted - just said that I had a wrong address and brought it to the sort facility about a 40 minute drive away. I don't have a car so asked for them to reattempt delivery and they said they could two days later, which was fine, but now they are saying that it might come tomorrow. They're not really sure when it will come and said to just wait around and they'll try their best.

3351,AnonymousButAngry,"Total negligenceI’ve had a few unacceptable experiences with Purolator. The worst and first was when I sent an express delivery package containing crucial medication to a family member and made sure to specify the importance of the package upon drop off. The package was MISPLACED and I received minimal support from the company in trying to locate the package despite seriously mounting anxiety about what could happen if the receiver would not receive the package within the flex time we had given ourselves to send the package. Luckily we ended up being able to replace the necessary drug despite it not being readily available at most pharmacies. Nevertheless, Purolator did not take the urgency of the situation seriously, considering someone’s life could be gravely affected without the medication. I got to the point where I considered whether I should contemplate legal action. A delivery that should have taken maximum 2 days ended up taking 10 and I was left in the dark the entire time - presumably because they had no information to share (?) - despite desperately communicating my concerns to them. I vowed never to use their service again but unfortunately I made a rare purchase online and didn’t notice Purolator would be the delivery company. Just now, I was trying to contact a representative from the company to address a complication with the delivery of the package. Despite the system telling me I would be on hold for 5 minutes, I ended up being on hold for 2 hours without any update about waiting times. During that time, I tried contacting them online in various ways and every method I attempted didn’t even allow me to submit my messages. In that time, I decide to cancel my order through Amazon who helped me resolve the issue and cancelled the order within 5 minutes. I stayed on the line with Purolator in the background just in the hopes of eventually trying to submit a complaint and to see how long it would ultimately take. This experience confirmed that I have never had a worst experience with a company before and despite not being the kind of person who writes reviews, I felt the need to share, albeit anonymously. I hope others will reconsider using their delivery service upon reading this review, though I feel it will only end up being a way to vent my anger more than anything.Date of experience: November 28, 2018"

It took an hour on hold with them to get through on the phone to them. They said the driver made a mistake as the package did not require a signature (it should have been left) and reluctantly said they would send it back to my house - in four days. Well, 6 days later, another door knocker saying I have to drive 20 miles!!!! Aghhhh - now I have wait for hours on the phone again.

My office building is in a roundabout so I figured maybe they didn't see it.I chat with someone online to be told that they attempted delivery to the wrong address. I tell the representative this is not my address and is not the address I gave in my order. I ask if they can attempt another delivery today, they can't, company policy says they must deliver to the address on the package. So I ask why did no one call me to ask me, my number was on the order. I am told and I quote ""It doesn't matter"", IT DOESN'T MATTER? Yes it does matter, a quick call would have at least let me know hey there's an issue. I get that they don't want people constantly changing the addresses and avoid theft but a little common sense would tell you if the address doesn't exist....call the customer. I am told I must wait until the next day. I go back later to check and the tracking status has not been updated.So I ask another representative what's going on and I am told the same spiel. I ask if she can make sure that it goes out tomorrow, she can't. I ask her to at least try, she says the other rep already sent a request. And now I'm being told it might even go to WEDNESDAY!

3366,Howard Wright,"Dismal Customer Service-They Don't Deserve to be in BusinessThis company doesn't deserve to be in business. On September 23, we issued a cheque which was one of a sequence in payment of 3 invoices. All the cheques in the sequence prior to and after the one issued to Purolator have cleared the bank and yet this one seems to have been lost. This is before any job action by Canada Post so the likely explanation is that it was mislaid by Purolator. In early October, Purolator refused to accept  a package citing the ""overdue invoices"". Next thing we knew, there was a demand for payment from a collection agency based in Quebec. Since the cheque had not cleared by the end of October, A new cheque was issued on November 9th for all invoices to date, including the three in question from September. This cheque cleared on November 19th. On November 23rd, they refused to accept a pickup, citing an unpaid invoice from November 9 (which arrived after the second cheque had been issued). Purolator has refused to lift the hold on the account until an invoice for $18.96 is paid, despite the fact that the original error was in all probability due to inefficiencies in their own Receivables department and the fact that we have had an ongoing business relationship dating back to 2012. My advice is put them out of their misery and don't use them. There are many better alternatives out there.Date of experience: November 26, 2018"

But nope, the driver doesnt even step foot out of the vehicle and drives off. Moments later i see in the order tracker: Delivery attempt unsuccesful. Not even a ticket at the door. I cannot even describe how furious i was. I then proceed to spend two hours waiting to get a customer service agent on the phone who tells me the only options are to wait until the following monday for either a new delivery attempt or pick up. I ask for the manager, nice man named Simba comes on the phone and reasures me we will find a solution. Perfect! Somebody who can help. Nope. He tells me hes sent emails to the purolator pick up locations manager and that one of them will call me as soon as they get the package returned so i may go pick it up that evening before they close at 8:30pm. Nobody calls so so i decide to drive 3 towns over where he told me it will be returned by the driver. I get there just before closing but apparently the driver still hasnt returned... this is 6 hours later.

When I brought this forward 3 times, when I had to pick up my package, I heard things like ""Oh he's a new driver."" , ""We don't go down a road if there is too much snow."" , ""Ohhhhhh, no we don't deliver down there.""  Seriously?!!! You just dropped something off last week and on many other occasions!  This latest incident is unbelievable.  I order 2 items from amazon.  I receive a phone call the day it is supposed to be delivered stating that I have a package to pick up.  Okay figures, once again.  Then that day, they deliver one of the items and not the other.  The next day I receive another message: You have an item for pick-up.  So in the end, they delivered one but won't deliver the other?!!! What a disorganized place!!  From now on, when I have a item to have delivered I am going to request that they not use purolator and if they insist, I will not be buying from there.Date of experience: November 16, 2018"
3393,Nathan Cashman,"Purolator is the worstPurolator is the worst! I had 3 monitors and a computer shipped to arrive yesterday(Thursday) Somehow, with all 4 pieces on the truck they only brought the monitors! My wife signed while I was a work. I should have told her it was four boxes, but the electronic pad she signed said 3 of 3 and she asked the driver, who confirmed that these are all the packages to be delivered to the house. I called yesterday to see if they could contact the driver to have them come back. I was told they can't reach their drivers?!?! I find it difficult to believe that their drivers are are out on their own with no communication to their depot/dispatch. Called again this morning and now an 'investigation' has been opened. This is COMPLETELY unacceptable because this shipment was from my work to set up a home office to start on Tuesday. I'm so p1ssed and will never use purolator ever and I will be making sure everyone who will listen will know not to deal with you.And don't you dare 'thank me for my feedback' Thank me by being a company that does what you're supposed to do!1diots!Date of experience: November 16, 2018"

3395,Laura Zerebeski,"Purolator / Unable to fulfil expidited delivery, falsified/erroneous tracking information, no follow-upThis has happened twice for my last two deliveries but IT NEVER USED TO HAPPEN. For years, Purolator was an efficient and reliable delivery service. Then something happened in the summer or fall of 2018.Two packages have gone missing. The first time, the package arrived about a week after it was promised. The second time, I paid extra to have the package of documents sent via expedited delivery, which was futile since  I have not yet received the package (now a week late and counting). For both packages, the tracking information shows that my address was ""incomplete"" and needed to be confirmed. Both times, I called and was placed on hold (about 10 to 20 mins) and confirmed that the address on package is correct. ""Must be a scan error, "" the agent said.The expedited package is a 3-day guaranteed shipment so I had the supplier call and ALSO confirm the address is correct. Purolator agent checked, agreed, and said it would be shipped on schedule. It says right there in the tracking information: ""Shipment scheduled for delivery next business day.""However, the package was not delivered, it is a week later, and the tracking information shows that my (already confirmed) address ""needs confirmation"" again and cannot be delivered.This is unacceptable.Both I and the supplier have intervened. Purolator and many other delivery services have delivered to my house before. The address to my house is well-marked and clearly visible. It is a quiet street with lots of parking in a central area in a major city. In fact, I received a package from Amazon on the same day the Purolator package was due to arrive.I then emailed Purolator at their customer care email; they responded within an hour and said they would investigate and get back to me within a few days. I had high hopes! So I waited to post this.Alas, it has been a week. No package, no Purolator response. Meanwhile, the package is still in ""Incomplete"" purgatory and I am on hold AGAIN for an agent (30 minutes so far).There appears to be no hope for human intervention. The supplier already refunded my expedited shipping fees but I still do not have my package.Tracking information:First package: 606091005060 - received a week lateSecond (expedited) package: 606135860983 - not yet received (one week late so far)Reference number for the follow up request where they said they would contact me by today is CS-8434634.I suppose the next step is to contact the supplier and get a complete refund for the documents which sucks for both of us.My theory is that Purolator Vancouver/Burnaby recently upgraded to a fully automated and failure-prone tracking system which has limited options other than blaming the customer or supplier for the system's constant misfires. Any tracking updates appear to be in the wee hours of the morning so the delivery people cannot be blamed. Robots are taking over the world and they are going to kill us with frustration. And, just as I typed that, at 36:30 minutes on hold, the hold system stopped playing that awful music and hung up on me. There is no recourse. We are doomed.Date of experience: November 16, 2018"

3397,HJ,"Terrible serviceTerrible service, equally bad customer service. Went to track my parcel and I have a notification that the delivery had failed as there was no receiver available. I was in the house the whole time so either the driver didn't arrive, or didn't knock very well. The driver left no note to say he had been so I contacted the Purolator live chat where I got through to a very unhelpful and frankly quite cheeky customer service advisor. My two options are apparently to get the parcel delivered in 2 days' time or pick it up 'whenever it becomes available for pick up'. Quite frustrating given the fact that my parcel was supposedly at my door half an hour ago. I asked when the parcel would be available for pick up and why we could not pick it up today and the agent was quite rude and terminated the chat. So now I have to wait another 2 days for the delivery which is ridiculous, given that I have paid for fast delivery. The salt on the wounds was the rude and frankly unacceptable standard of customer service by one of your agents. Manners cost nothing. Won't be using your company's services again. Fully deserving of the terrible reputation.*** Edit ***Later spoke to a helpful agent over the phone who advised me that the driver had in fact went to the wrong address and attempted to deliver my items there. Lucky nobody was in at the time or my items may have been stolen. My only options are to wait another 2 days for my item to be redelivered (hopefully to the correct address this time) or for me to wait until they call me to let me know when I can pick my item up. The depot is only 20 mins from my house yet the it can't be delivered sooner than 2 days after the driver tried to deliver it to the wrong address.

I badly needed it. And yes, it is supposed to be delivered on time if only Purolator did their job. We live in a private apartment (no one can go in unless you have an access in the building) and normally with FedEx and UPS, the deliverer always call us ahead of time so we can go out and wait for our package to arrived. (They are even calling us multiple times if we missed their first call) My package is supposed to be here by Saturday 11/10/18, the deliverer from this company left a note in front of our building saying they missed us. (They never called). 11/13/18 I tracked my package online and it says it will be delivered by 9pm today. My husband went out at 10am only to see the same note from this company saying they miss us.

3404,Joe Average,"Once again Purolator fails to deliverOnce again Purolator fails to deliver. This is becoming a chronic issue. The latest is still ongoing. My order landed in Purolator warehouse Monday night (Nov 6). In normal circumstances and with reliable couriers, I would have received this Tuesday. I didn't. Wednesday, tracking still shows Tuesdays message ""Delayed due to sorting error"". Not delivery Wednesday either so I initial an investigation. Tyler Allen reaches out & spews some excuses. He contacts me again at noon to advise ""I checked with the courier manager and have included his response below. He says the driver will deliver these pieces today."". Another lie. I waited around all afternoon & no delivery. I'm still waiting.Should Purolator themselves see fit to respond to this, I'm not interested in excuses or claims that you're unusually busy. I don't care. You have a systemic problem with the management at Nanaimo. I've been a regular customer for nearly 20 years & have seen poor service degrade to worthless. I have no beef with the drivers. They have been exceptional. The high rotation of drivers says a lot but proof is when you question the drivers about delivery issues. There is a strong sentiment being put forth that most, if not all issues, are the result of the Nanaimo nitwits at the helm.EDITED 11/09/2018 in response to Purolator's comments:The shipment arrived this morning. If you truly want to do something about this mess, replace management in Nanaimo. It's apparent to me they are beyond their skill set.Date of experience: November 09, 2018"

Rushed outside in the snow without my t-shirt on, I was greeted by a very, very nice guy. He was down to Earth, he didn't mind that the signature was a bit different because the product was on my mum's name. Was easy to talk to and the main thing is that my ordered product came in DAYS. I ordered it a few days ago then bang, it's already here.

It's time to make some changes, Purolator.Date of experience: October 25, 2018"
3431,Wojciech Sawicki,"If there is a rock bottom, they rank a few miles beneath it...Just about the most frustrating experience imaginable. I've ordered an item with Amazon Prime, specifically choosing two-day guaranteed delivery as we're ONLY able to wait for the courrier on Mondays. So what does the courrier do? They NEVER rang the buzzer, just stuck an ""attempted delivery"" notice on the front door, with instructions to pick the package up at their Montreal shipping center the next day (October 23rd). Customer service on the phone couldn't do anything to turn the lying driver around for another (REAL) attempt. Fine, pickup it is, that's a day late already, but fine, I can forgive that much. So what happens? I waste hours getting to the shipping center, only to be told rudely ""The package isn't here, it's on a truck for delivery tomorrow"". The girl behind the counter then proceeded to INSIST that I've called to request another delivery on Wednesday, October 24th!!! Absurd! NOBODY will be there to receive it, and NOBODY made such a request - a fact confirmed by a quick phonecall right there at the desk. Once called out on this lie, she became even more rude. NO apology was offered, just outright insulting attempts to somehow blame me instead. And of course, the usual claims that nothing can be done to undo that catastrophic screwup (what's the point of her job then, anyway??). So at that point not only it's two days late, but THREE days late at least! Surely enough, another ""attempted delivery"" notice was stuck on the front door today, despite making it abundantly clear to the company, on two separate occasions by then, that NOBODY IS THERE. Their only chance was MONDAY and if only the driver did his damn job, we wouldn't be having this problem. If only they followed their own notices and held the package for pickup, we would only be a day late and we wouldn't be having this problem. If they weren't blatantly lying and making things up, we wouldn't be having this problem. As things are now, I'm not even sure I'll actually be able to finally pick up my stuff tomorrow (three days late), or will I end up wasting my time again? I have NEVER yet seen such a convoluted mess of glaring incompetence and repeated screwups following one another. What's the point of paying for a specific-day delivery if the courrier at the end of the delivery process simply doesn't give a damn, and NOBODY in the whole company can (or cares to) do anything about it.Date of experience: October 25, 2018"
3432,Bartu Gürel,"WORST SHIPPING FIRM EVERWORST SHIPPING FIRM EVER. I ordered 4 batteries for my e-bike so I can work. On the delivery day, they say because there was no-buzzer number they did not make the delivery but we do not have a buzzer number in our apartment. And the couriers do not carry a phone to call the customer before they arrive. That is why they won't do the delivery and because of them, I will lose 4 days of work which I could save a lot of money. I am a student and I have a school. Do I have to wait for them to come to my apartment 24/7 ?

When I said “sir I am going to record this conversation on video and share it online to show how badly you behave with customer “ only then he put his act together and made the delivery .Today my package ref number # I was called at 10:37 and I was at front door 10:39 and the delivery person has already left .Leaving a note that they could not contact me .This is horrible customer service and repeated behavior of dissatisfied customer .I will advise all service provides to not use purolator for their delivery because they just don’t provide delivery service .Very unhappy with purolator .

Our Amazon.ca package was supposed to be here Sunday, they say delvery attempt was made, but they could not gain access to the building, why, because their driver didn't READ the access panel which CLEARLY states how to buzz apartments!! Called Amazon.ca, we were refunded entire order cost and told our package would be here ASAP. On Monday the Amazon app shows an attempted delivery at 10:34 AM, but I never got a door buzz. I called Purolator (I was LIVID!!), was informed that they did not attempt to deliver, they had however entered our buzzer code into their system. Tuesday, I waited ALL day, watching the Amazon app ""out for delivery"" then ""your package is late due to external factors"" ????? Called Purolator, ""your expected wait time is 7-10 minutes, HALF AN HOUR LATER a customer service rep answers my call. Driver ran out of time to deliver our package and returned to warehouse?!?! Called Amazon, like there is much they can do about it, but customer service agent said that Purolator and Canada Post were a 50/50 if your package will be delivered. Sent off an email to Amazon as well, looks like Purolator is hanging by a thread, I truly hope that this is the end of their contract with Amazon!!! So here I sit for a FOURTH day waiting, what is my time worth?!?!?! Wonder if our elusive package will arrive today? Your delivery service is ridiculously poor!!! Teach your drivers to READ buzzer instructions on apartments!!! And leave delivery attempt slips!! Was told you don't leave them at apartment complexes anymore as they tend to fall into the wrong hand, I call BS as you have to provide government ID to pick up packages anyway!!!

I wonder what miracle is keeping this company afloat till now. Every time my parcel came via Purolator, the driver never delivered it even if I was home. Last week my gf's parcel was delivered to wrong building and she had to ask Amazon for refund. Everyone is saying same thing ...your drivers never deliver the parcel...How come CanadaPost, Fedex and UPS drivers are doing it better than you? They aren't hiring aliens...are they? I am waiting for the day Purolator as company will be dissolved because then Amazon wont send the parcels via you guys anymore.

3444,Primary Residents,"Unbelievable poor serviceUnbelievable poor service. I had a large package shipped from ON to Calgary, with an estimated delivery day of October 16th. Took the day off of work so I would be available to receive the delivery. Checked the tracking website the 16th, still on time. It was due to arrive before 8PM. Even at 10PM on the 16th it was still due to arrive on time. Checked the tracking info on the 17th, it was delayed while in tranist. Did not expect the delivery to be on the truck that day as it was just accepted by the depot late that night. On the 18th at 8AM it was on a truck for delivery, indeed it was but not to my house. Because of the delay Purolator had sent it off to an agent who would handle the delivery. I call mid-afternoon Friday to see where my package it. The agent I talk with doesn't have an update. I was promised a call back that day from a tracking agent, I receive no call back. The 19th I get a call in from my from door buzzer, I'm unavailable to answer. When I get back to my house later that evening, there is no attempted delivery notice, I assume it was not my delivery. But it was, on the 22nd Purolator tracking info is updated. I have been in contact with Amazon and Purolator, and with no real answers. Today is the 22nd, apparently, a tracing agent is working on finding my package, which I've requested to just go pick up myself. I just don't understand how a shipping company can lose a package that's been in the city (Calgary) since the 16th, today is the 22nd.Will the tracing agent call me back today, seeming as they only work 9-5 M-F, and are dealing with 100's of other cases probably not. Purolator needs to hire more staff, to get the job done right. Other than physically picking up and delivery of packages, logistics are the backbone of your operation and you are clearly failing.Also if you're going to contract out shipments ensure an equal level of service, and at least get them to leave a notice of attempted delivery and where the customer can get their package from.Date of experience: October 22, 2018"

3470,Marc Meunier,"Honest reviewI recently ordered PC parts from Newegg, and was assigned Purolator as my shipping company. I decided to check out who ""Purolator"" were, because I had never been shipped items by them (I usually use Amazon and I'm assigned UPS or FedEx). Eventually, I decided to read the reviews here and to be honest, I can kind of understand why this company is rated 0.4 stars out of 5.I was meant to wait 2 days to receive my items but instead it took 4 days, which is understandable because upon placing my orders, turns out my apartment number was not included. The reason why is because I paid with PayPal and it took that address (which doesn't have my apartment number included in the address) instead of the address I manually entered (which did contain the apartment number) but that's Newegg's fault, not Purolator's.Upon realizing that, I updated my address but the items were already shipped so that didn't change anything. I decided to call their Technical Support number, was told I would be waiting for an agent for about 5 minutes but ended up waiting 30 minutes instead so that's something. After 30 minutes had passed, an agent answered me, he was kind of rude. I explained my situation, and he told me to call tomorrow at 10:00 AM so they would inform the driver of the updated address. Next day comes, I didn't actually bother to wait until that time, and contacted their Live Chat Support at 8:00 AM instead. I was assigned ""Elizabeth B"" as my agent, and she was a pleasure to talk to and work with. She erased my doubts in 10 minutes of talking, so A+ for Elizabeth. On that same day, my items were coming so I decided to wait until my items arrived because the driver did not know my apartment number. From 9:00 AM to 4:40 PM, I just sat there looking out the window waiting for Purolator to show up, and they did. They did show up, except that as soon as the driver arrived and he realized it was an apartment complex, he left right away. He left so fast that I couldn't even go down the stairs outside to grab my stuff and for the record, that takes about 5 seconds for me. Needless to say, that made me very mad.My tracking number updated to ""Address correction needed"" which I didn't have to worry about, because Elizabeth said that they would work that correction on their own and re-deliver 2 days later. The next day, I contacted their Live Chat Support again and asked if I could go pick up my stuff myself and I was told that they would send a request for that. The tracking number would update itself when my items were ready to pick up, and it did just do that, so that's nice. The closest Purolator was a 10-minutes drive, which is more than acceptable. I went there, and successfully picked up ONE package out of two. I was surprised they didn't have both of my items, and it confused me. It confused me because the item they had was the one that I had ordered second. I have absolutely zero idea where my first package was and why it wasn't there at the time.I, again, contacted their Live Chat Support asking where the first package was and was told it wasn't at the depot. That's... weird, but okay. I then CLEARLY stated, in English (the language the person was speaking), that they should not deliver it (it was due for delivery on the next day) and that I would instead pick it up when ready. The person understood me, and said that I could go pick it up tomorrow. The next day, my tracking number said that the item was on its way. I was confused, very confused. I, again, contacted their Live Chat Support about this matter and was told that unfortunately they couldn't reach out to the depot or something like that. I didn't understand what that meant, but at this point whatever. I knew that they came late, so I didn't have to sit there waiting AND plus they had my apartment number this time. I went with it.At about 3:00 PM, they delivered with no issue. The only complaint I have is that the driver DID NOT request a signature, which I clearly paid for when ordering that item off Newegg because it cost me $640 so I definitely did not want that to get stolen or anything, so I paid an extra $5 to have a signature required. The driver, instead, left the package right outside of my door. I don't even think he/she knocked or ever rang the bell. That is unacceptable. Now, I trust the people inside of my apartment complex, I know it wouldn't have been stolen but still, that isn't something you do, especially when I've paid out of my own pocket to have a signature upon delivery. The one good thing in all of this is that I had a tab of my tracking number opened on my pc, while playing Overwatch. When the tracking number updated itself, it made a sound to alert me that it was delivered, so that's pretty good, I guess.All in all, my items are undamaged and 4 days waiting time isn't that big of a deal but there's a lot of things wrong with this situation. Had I chosen Amazon, I wouldn't have had all of these issues. I wouldn't say Purolator is not trustworthy, but they have a lot of work to do or rather, common sense to work on.A+ for Live Chat Support. The people I've talked to were all welcoming, responsive and helpful.Would I recommend Purolator? Not really. Think it's pretty self-explanatory.Would I choose Purolator again? No. Why would I when I can have UPS or FedEx and not have to worry about anything. I have ordered dozens of items off Amazon and have never had any problem, I've never even had to contact Support.Date of experience: September 29, 2018"

A few days later I found on the tracking site that my parcel is now in TORONTO!!! I phoned to complain that I still never received any phone call for delivery or pickup, I gave the other rep my tracking number and she replies with my phone number ending in 66!!!

It went back to warehouse labelled incorrect address when it wasn't!!I contacted them and they blamed me for not putting company name instead of my name. All of our office mail that comes in has personal names with the office address which we even get from Canada post, Fedex ect. and NEVER had any issues until this.

Now an hour later instead of ""On vehicle for delivery"" my status is ""Delayed in transit due to disruption"".  I'm not entirely sure what in my sub division is causing a disruption but I could have walked 10 feet to the truck when I saw it and got my package.  Now I have to wait another entire day likely to just be told that I need to come pick it up.  Sure glad I took the time off work to get home to accept the package otherwise I'd have to go pick it up anyway.  You dickwads better be delivering it tomorrow on a Saturday.Seriously, how are you artards still in business?  How?  How does one make money not delivering packages?Every time I see something is delivered by Purolator I just know that I'm going to have to go pick the f'n thing up.  The last delivery we had the driver didn't leave an attempted delivery sticker.  The only reason I knew it was attempted was that the status had changed on my tracking to delivery attempted.

So far they have tried  Delivering  this 2 wrong address the past 2 days and to companies that don't even have name close to  ours. The address they are trying to deliver to are 7 blocks away from here. The address are not even close and I cant understand why they cant get it right. Then now they have the nerve to say the address on the label is wrong. I called and confirmed that the address is correct on the label and its being delivered to the wrong address in error by the driver. So now its 2 days late and no one is trying to fix this. You would think since they keep making the same error that get this rectified ASAP. NOPE!!! now I m being told to bad and I wont see this until next week. This is unacceptable and as of right now my customers are furious! I don't understand why the driver can not comeback and fix this now. This is not only 1 but 2 errors by Purolater , its not my fault the driver cant read a map (this is the only explanation i could think of that makes sense) and deliver this to the address on the label!!! Its pretty straight forward, the address on the label is easy to understand since its a huge warehouse with 34 loading docks and the building is clearly marked. I kid you not that Purolater comes here every day and pick up.

3495,David Lambert,"Oh you want it? go get it yourself. No I won't deliver it. I don't care that I'm a delivery company.Imagine sitting at a restaurant table, you've ordered, and are waiting on the food. Waiter comes out of the kitchen with the food, walks around the dining room with it looking around lost, then goes back to the kitchen. You call him over, ask him where you food is, and he says ""oh, I tried to deliver it but I missed you"". Logically your response is ""I was sitting at the table the whole time?!"" and he replies ""sorry, you are going to need to go to the kitchen and get it yourself"". Now the kitchen isn't 10 seconds away though, your food actually went onto a truck and was brought to another kitchen 30+ minutes away and will only be available for pickup 2+ days later. This has happened with 4 different packages in the past 2 weeks. A delivery company that doesn't successfully deliver packages 95% of the time is not a delivery company, just like a restaurant that doesn't feed you 95% of the time you order food isn't a restaurant, they are just room with tables and chairs that waste your time, give you attitude when you complain, and don't make any kind of attempt to improve. The fact that they are still in business completely astounds me, and why anyone would work with them, or work for them in 2018 is beyond comprehension. I know the response to this will be ""what is your tracking number?"".

3496,Tommy g,"Unacceptable service from Purolator in this day and age.I ordered an expensive computer from Dell, which shipped in August. The estimated delivery date was September the 5th. The tracking number page confirmed that the package was on its way, September 4th and arriving on schedule. I live in Ontario and the package was shipping from Toronto (2 hours away from me) One week later after hearing absolutely nothing, my package surfaces. 40 hours away across the country in Vancouver British Colombia. After contacting Dell, I was told that although Purolator had made an error, it would be corrected and i could expect my package in another week before September 15th. Today the tracking site said my package was on the truck for delivery. Hoping to avoid any chance in missing my parcel and having it re-routed or returned to sender, I waited on my front porch the entire day, thinking surely a 3000$ computer would be the first thing going out. The whole day went by without a delivery, and without an update. I contacted Purolator by chat and was told, sorry they didn't attempt to deliver it today, we will update you on Monday the 17th. When I told them that Dell customer service had guaranteed me I would have my package by the 15th, and asked if I could get added to a weekend shipment, they simply repeated. Sorry, update Monday, as if it was a perfectly normal occurance to ship a package from a city 2 hours away, across the country and back, and then say it was arriving that day, and not even attempt to deliver it, or post an update.Edit*** If someone representing Purolator is thinking of adding a response to the bottom of my comment about ""Looking into"" my case. Be sure that the ""looking"" will result in ""action"" that will not result in me canceling a $3000 order with Dell, as I am highly concerned about the condition of the delicate machinery being thrown from truck to truck and depot to depot across our fine country and back again.Date of experience: September 15, 2018"

He said yes....HE SAID YES.But he starts going to the elevator. I assume my package was on the bottom of his pile and thats fair. I can wait. 10 minutes later he has marked my package on amazon as ""cannot access door"".....really?? REALLY!? its a door...thats open...that has the address in 2 foot tall numbers next to it.So i contact amazon and am informed since the driver just left moments ago they can get him to turn around and go back. So she connects me with purolator. The agent says he needs info from me. Name, address etc. Then say I can pick it up as lonf as i bring letterhead from my company proving i work there..First of my name is ON THE PARCEL second, if i wanted to come pick it up I would have gone to the store and bought the items and not bothered with amazon. Sadly i dont have the time to do that.I ask if he can send the driver back and he said no because...they dont have the address.  Heres how that convo went downIts on the box....No we dont have itBut you do because he was hereWe cant send him back without an addressOkay here it is then (repeat addy to him)Yeah i cant sent him back Why?Cause we dont have the address.Well can you have it sent for tomorrowNo, monday onlyWell that doesnt work. So please send the order back to the shipper.Then im talking with the amazon agent and she thinks it ridiculous. She sends the situation to her supervisor and gives me a refund.

I spoke to a customer service representative prior to the day the shipment would arrive, because I knew I wouldn’t be there and I live in a shady neighborhood, I didn’t want them to leave my 200$ cat’s tree in front of my door, since I knew that it would get stolen. I asked them to leave it to their closest location so I could pick it up OR to ring number 25, which is the janitor. The customer service person told me that they couldn’t ring to number 25 because the address I entered was different, and that even though they fully knew I wouldn’t be there they would try and deliver the package anyway. How absurd is that? Also, she told me not to worry, that if I wasn’t there when they delivered, they would automatically bring the package to their nearest location for me to pick it up.

3511,Hendi Lim,"Worst delivery company everA few months ago I ordered an item from Amazon, the seller used Purolator for delivery. The delivery man just dropped the item on my doorstep and never bothered pressing the doorbell. The item finally got stolen a couple hours after being left outside and it was all recorded on my doorbell camera. Last week, I ordered a $400 big sized item again from Amazon, unfortunately I did not know that the seller would use Purolator as their courrier. If I had known about it, I would have not bought the item. The item arrived and again the delivery man not once bothered to press the doorbell. They just chucked the item on my doorstep and left it out in the open so people can steal it.Stay away! Use them only if you are shipping out items that are indestructible and have zero value because they don't give a damn.Date of experience: September 08, 2018"

Second time when I finally got my way to the wrong address and made an appointment. Scheduled between 12:30-1:30, Purolator decided they didn’t like that time and told me it has been changed to anywhere before 5:30. And again nobody came. I called Purolator customer service and was told that the driver didn’t like the address and didn’t want to pick up, and the person made my appointment canceled it without contacting me or gotten my permission. I asked if I should just guess if the driver is coming at all the service dude said yes. I asked are there anything they will do to make up all this mess and trouble they’ve caused me, answer was no. Worse company in Canadian history. What a shame!Date of experience: September 08, 2018"
3513,Ash,"Can't contact their call centreCan't contact their call centre - Experiencing technical difficulties today ( or everyday)  - and the line disconnects. And their online chat agents are completely USELESS.The buzz code for your building is the defining factor whether this service will deliver your item or not. Even if you provide a direct phone number that you can be reached at to make for a SEAMLESS and hassle-free delivery drop, the driver's won't call upon arrival. Purolator Ground doesn't allow their drivers to call customers.The first Chat agent I spoke with, Janice L., was rude and ended the chat before I was done - she just told me to call the call centre and closed the window. I spoke with two others who provided no solution to ensure my item got to me. Nobody cared, nobody tried to discuss the matter with a higher up to ensure that I got my item since I don't have the means to go pick it up at a location (I ordered a desk). Very rigid policies, no ownership from anyone and no flexibility. Nobody in this company gives a damn. If I see that a business uses them as their third-party delivery service, I'll either not buy or cancel my order - which I had to do in this case.  #diasppointed.Date of experience: September 08, 2018"

3517,Alli P,"Worst company imaginableWorst company imaginable. If I could give them negative stars I would. I made an order off Amazon. My package wasn’t even sent out for delivery until 10:15am. Unlike others, I went to work today thinking they would leave the package on my door step if my husband or I wasn’t home. Get home from work at 4pm and there’s no package. I check my tracking number and it says it’s still out for delivery. No problem. I have no intention of going out tonight as it is. At about 5:40pm I checked the tracking again. APPARENTLY they “attempted delivery” at 5:18pm. I can tell you right now that that’s a lie. I was sitting in the living room right by the door waiting for it. I do not live in an apartment building so there would be no issues with this driver walking right up to my front door and knocking. As far as their “attempted delivery” goes.... there isn’t even a note on my door giving me options! This guy must’ve just decided he was done for the day and went home and called it an “attempted delivery.” When I called to question this I was told my only options were to drive 1.5 hours round trip to go pick it up or wait until tomorrow. Clearly Scott on the phone didn’t like my response which was to tell the obviously incompetent driver to turn around and actually finish work for the day instead of being lazy. So now I’m waiting for them to deliver tomorrow where HOPEFULLY either my husband or I will be home to receive this package. Don’t worry. I’ve already talked to Amazon who is lodging a complaint also. You guys should consider going out of business since you’re a shady company with horrible business practices.Date of experience: September 04, 2018"

3519,Adam ,"Worst Customer service experience I have ever had...Purolator Lost my medication..I ordered my meds as per usual from my producer. Paid extra to have it shipped in one Business day with Purolater vs cheaper two day shipping with Canada post. Delivery day comes and no package. I go on the website and send a complaint via live chat. The ladies in the live chat had a supervisor get involved upon my request and had a tracking specialist put on my case. The supervisor calls and gives me the most useless response you could expect basically telling me he can't do anything. Then I am told the tracking specialist would contact me from both live chat reps and supervisor. The Tracking specialist (not sure if you can even call them that) contacts me via email apologizing for the delay and thanking me for my patience. I received that same cookie cut response from her about 6 times and have yet to receive a follow up call or any sort of acknowledgment that my package was lost/mishandled.  The package miraculously arrived 24 hours after filing the complaint (late at this point). Purolator failed to tell me what was happening with my parcel, failed to deliver it on time And failed to follow up with my request to report the issue. I have yet to talk to anyone that can do something regarding such terrible service. They are charging a premium for shipping vs Canada post. I don't see the added value? Why did I pay more for service like this? Should I ask the thousands of unhappy customers that write similar reviews? I will go out of my way to never use Purolator after this and I hope my review helps customers make a similar decision. Don't apologize for our inconvenience.....Do better.Date of experience: August 31, 2018"

They are also the only carrier that cannot deliver to condo/apartment buildings. When I called them after an ""attempted delivery"", trying to give instructions for delivering to my building, the staff answering the phone actually did not know what a condo was, and it took a great deal of explanation. In the end they told me that they cannot deliver to condos (Or any secure buildings) because their drivers don't have any way to communicate with a recipient in order to gain access.They are utterly useless as a delivery company, as they will always force you to go pick up any items from their locations anyway.Date of experience: August 30, 2018"

3523,Mel,"Worst Service all aroundI was supposed to receive my package Monday but it was delivered and not left on my porch. I did not receive notification that I needed to be there for a signature, so i wasn't. So I went on a live chat with someone on Monday and I ask them to change the address so it can be delivered Tuesday. I did not trust live chat was a real human agent so I kept asking for some sort of proof that the change in address had been made. I was being told it was and nothing. I was told they would do it at the depot and that I couldn't do anything about it. Very unprofessional basically telling me that's tough.When you try and click the “ Not available to receive your shipment?” link under the tracking details,  it shows this sorry screen that it does not exist. So what is a customer supposed to do if they cannot receive it, or give alternative instructions? How does that make sense you are not giving your customers any options!!So Tuesday rolls around and I wait all day and nothing. I would have thought that since there was a delivery attempt on Monday at 10 am that I could expect something in the morning since the address change is literally 5 minutes away from the original location. So I wait. Then I leave the office at 6pm and leave an authorization that says my name, address, tracking detail, where the package is from and that they have authorization to just leave it at the porch. I have attached the authorization.Then I get a message saying it was “undeliverable” at 7:22. When Purolator indicates the driver could be out until 8 pm that is nonsense it was undeliverable. The driver simply was too lazy to deliver it. The building was open and available for the driver to drop it off. This was absolutely not the drivers call to just not show up because they did not feel like it. There was no reason it could not be delivered.On Wednesday  I called the customer service number and spoke to someone who did not introduce himself, he was not helpful, he didn’t answer my questions. He basically said that he was leaving a note for the driver to know my hours at the office are until 5 and that I would be leaving a note to authorize leaving the package there. I asked why he could not deliver a message to the driver saying to get here before 5 since Burlington and Oakville are so close. He said the driver picks where he goes on the route.So I have waited 3 days to be told tough tits the driver decides when you get it and Purolator head office has no way of ensuring when I will get it or where. They do not have tabs on their drivers and have no control over if the drivers make their deliveries.I suspect the driver is inputting false records due to the fact that my package was deemed “unable to deliver” when in reality there were no barriers for the driver to drop it off. Purolator should be ashamed they are still in business.Date of experience: August 29, 2018"

I called before I shipped them out and was told that I would only need one waybill because the boxes were all going to the same address.So, I shipped out the four boxes. 2 big and 2 on the smaller side. Three days later I get a call from them saying I needed to fill out a Unaccompanied Goods form for customs. The form was the most confusing form ever. They don't have people trained to help customers with these confusing form. Then they revealed to me that they only had 2 of my boxes there and couldn't find the smaller two. So, after a week of struggling to figure out this form I was told to just fill it out for the 2 big boxes because they found the smaller boxes and they had already made it past the boarder. When asked why the boxes were separated they couldn't give me an answer. Annoying but all good right/ Nope...I arrived in America for my visit and I checked over my boxes and the smaller of the 4 boxes were still no where to be found and the 2 big boxes were completely destroyed. I had a ceramic elephant that wasn't just broken it was shattered. I had a lamp that was broken...a knife set holder had been broken... everything in those boxes I had to get rid of. But to get any money for it you need receipts. If you've had items for years you wouldnt have receipts and thats where they get you. They egt away with bad service and destroying boxes and losing boxes because they know there's a 90% chance you wont have any receipts.

I ordered a coffee table from amazon since 1-2 weeks ago, and unfortunately, my table is going to be sent with purolator. The first estimated time to be expected, nobody came to my apartment. I called them, and they rearranged again for the next business day to try again. The second time, again nobody showed up. I got a call from them and they said nobody is at home; REALLY??? I am at home the entire day and they have the nerve to say nobody is at home??? Again, I rearranged with them for another delivery, and they said this time might be the last time to try to deliver as it is impossible to send again. So today on Monday, after the weekends passed by, I woke up at 6 am and waited by the door for them. The morning was cold and I felt sleepy, so around 9.45 am something, I went back to my apartment for a while for a hot shower. Just as I got to my phone, I received an email saying that the delivery was attempted, but nobody is at home. WHAT THE - AGAIN?!?!?!?!I hate it. I hate purolator. I have no car, and I am a student living alone, just how many times must I be this way?? How am I suppose to carry a heavy package all by myself?? I am trying to reach out to Canada Post right now to see if they could help me. But I cannot stand this stupid service any longer. How is it possible this business is still up and running?? The one star is even the most courtesy I could give to them, just because so far their customer service through the phone is fairly ok and respectful.

I live in a condo which has a concierge to receive packages for pickup and no one is home during the day. I have critical medicine to be delivered for my daughter and no matter what I do, Purolator will not deliver the medicine. I've spent so long on the phone with them, and so has the pharmacy. It's been a week now. They simply will not deliver unless I'm physically there to sign, no matter how many times both the pharmacy and I instruct them to deliver to the concierge. One operator I spoke to read back to me what she wrote. Her instructions said AT LEAST 4 TIMES to leave the medicine with the concierge, yet they won't do it. I've read the reviews on this site and on 2 others. It's all the same. This company seems to be universally hated by everyone that uses them. It's unbelievable how they're still in business....Adding comments due to the reply below. Both the sender and I were on the phone in conference call with Purolator and instructions were provided, both verbally and in writing to leave the medicine with the concierge. I understand chain of custody, but this issue was addressed. The sender is equally exasperated. We both agreed it was best to recall the order and instead to ship it to my work so I can sign for it there. What really put me over the top was the hours I've spent, while at work, trying to get this resolved by being on hold with Purolator, day after day. And when I finally insisted on speaking to a Supervisor, I thought I would get help, and instead I got a snarky attitude.And to top it all off, for all Purolator’s haranguing about how they can’t deliver because of “chain of custody”, and being unable to change the instructions even if they’re given by both the sender and the recipient and in writing. Purolator then shipped the new package to my work, and one of my co-workers signed for it - not me! What complete hypocritical imbeciles.Date of experience: August 20, 2018"

Item #1 Is shipped on Wednesday and is received by Intelcom Courrier Canada Inc. on Thursday 4:19am, and is out for delivery at 7:38am.Package Is delivered and signed for as of 11:28am.Item #2 Is shipped on the evening of Wednesday, picked up by Purolator at 8:59pm, item is once again shipped after passing through multiple facilities to the intended sorting facitility. 7:03am Friday, item arrives at sorting facility. Package is then placed on vehicle for delivery in local area at 8:02am, to which the delivery is then delayed as of 10:40am due to a ""incorrect address"". Calls are made with the Customer service representative to determine the root cause of the issue. Customer service representative informs the client that the item was not delivered due to mentioned issue above, and will not be be available until the vehicle returns to the facility. However, the package will be held so that the client can pick up the item without issue. Requests are made to determine what time the item will be available, to which the customer representative states will be end of day. Client goes to depot for package, only to be informed that the item is still on the truck, and is advised to contact the customer service representative once again.Client once again contacts customer service representative, to which the CS rep advises the client that due to the location of the storage facility the item won't be returned to the depot until after-hours. Customer service representative advises the client of the current options, pick-up the item as of Monday morning, or have the item delivered with a 1 business-day delay on Tuesday. Client requests that the item be delivered on Tuesday with the delay, considering no other options are available. Key points:- One courier maintained no difficulty reading off the address, and delivering the item quickly and efficiently.- Purolator appears to be unable to determine the written address and effectively deliver the item. - Client's aren't contacted via phone while the item is out for delivery (The agents do not have cell-phones)- Information passed between the facilities and drivers is severly deprecated. - Amazon does not offer the option to select the ""courier""Date of experience: August 17, 2018"

3546,Vien Chen,"No more!I went to the Vancouver downtown location to pick up my amazon prime package for the first time. There was nobody working at the counter when I entered the store, shortly a female employee came out and brought my package out sooner after. I bought 2 small stuff but the package box was huge. I knew it was not their fault but Amazon’s, however, I was with my baby and I needed both of my hands to push the stroller, the box didnt fit in the stroller basket even if I folded it. By the way, I use Uppababy Vista stroller which has a huge basket. I took out the two tiny stuff I bought and kindly asked the lady if she could recycle the box for me. She refused and the reason was because their recycle bin was full. I told her I wouldn’t be able to push the stroller if I carried that box, and asked if she knew any garbage bin nearby that I could just run to throw the box and come back. She said she didn’t know any. So I was stuck there with a giant box and a stroller in the store and she was just not willing to help at all. In the end I placed the box on the top of the stroller canopy and carefully push the stroller out. Their automatic door was not working which made it even harder. And the lady was just there again not even willing to help. After I exited the door and saw all their bins, none of them was full. I would understand if it’s the store policy, but to lie to the customer is just not a good practice for your customer service.Date of experience: August 14, 2018"
3547,Lori Murphy,"Will never use Purolator again!I recently shipped an envelope overnight delivery to a location 1 hour from me.  The receiver could not answer the door at the time, there was no attempt at re-delivery and they left a note for the receiver to pick up the parcel at their depot 30 mins away - each way.  (back towards my location)   The lack of pick up options in that area is not my logistic problem.  The receiver is not accustomed to shipping process and drove all the way to neighboring city to pick up the parcel the following day. I paid for a service, they did not deliver.   I refuse to pay for the delivery & they refuse to refund me.  I have been shipping in my business for 20 years and will never use Purolator again!  I spoke to a manager, who had no answer regarding the logistics of where the parcel was delivered for pick up.  How can they think this is even remotely acceptable to deliver the parcel to another city for receiver to pick up?  Beyond comprehension and clearly shows me that they do not care about customer service!Date of experience: August 13, 2018"
3548,R J,"Our delivery guy left a parcel…Our delivery guy left a parcel containing electronics in the rain all day, despite the covered porch available literally 3 feet away from where the box was dumped. Now I have to return the item and wait for a replacement to ship - probably an extra week on an item that I paid for 2 day shipping on. Total waste of time. Purolator are the worst. I usually avoid ordering if they are doing the delivery but with Amazon you never know who it’s going to ship with. FedEx and UPS can be hit and miss, but you know if Purolator are involved it’s going to be a farce.——————Update. I got a response from Purolator asking for more details to this review and have sent pictures which show the soaked box. The response indicated that they are following up because it was left in the rain when a dry place was available, NOT because it was left in the rain which is perfectly acceptable to them. I also see the same cookie cutter response to literally thousands of 1 star reviews, so clearly the message isn’t being acted on...Date of experience: August 13, 2018"

Ok. Fine, how about a time-frame so I can keep an eye out? ""Before 6pm""Fine, I can roll with that. I left a note on my door asking them to come up to the apartment directly, and ensured they could get into the building. I then get the notification that they tried to deliver, no success.I went down, and the door was still accessible, and there was no slip on it, so either a) they willfully ignored my simple instructions and were like ""f it"", or they didn't even get out of the van.I was banking on getting this package today, and now to ensure I have it in time, I have to bus across the city (which will take me like 3 hours there and back).Completely unacceptable in this day and age.

My dogs ran into the street at the man honking his horn on a road that has a speed limit of 80km. My dogs do not leave the yard! there was 2 epcor men working out there for at least 2 hours earlier my outside dog barked at the gate and my inside dogs did their business and sunbathed in the yard. I asked the man what in gods name he was doing parking in the middle of the road honking his horn he informed me rather yelled in broken english as he smoked a cigarette in his vehicle that he was here yesterday and that the outside dog scared him. He is an outside dog that's his job i explained also that if he was so scared he could drop it off at the postal service and we would pick it up. He told me to eff off and not to order from them again he threw my package at the ground in the middle of the road for me to pick it up he then put his vehicle in drive and drove into my drive way directly at my dogs in a very aggresive manner as if trying to run them over.

I immediately called Purolator to hopefully get them to get the driver to turn around, but of course, my notification arrived 1 hour after the ""attempt"" and the offices are closed. For the fun of it, I pressed ""2"" to track my package, and now it says that receiver was unavailable, when I was at home the whole time and no one rang the bell. Frustrated, I went on live chat, to be made even angrier by the agent who knew nothing and could not answer my questions to save her life. I didn't even care if I had to pick up the package myself, yet she cannot even confirm that it can be done. I'll have to cross my fingers that the request will be accepted for me to pick up, apparently. I asked about the labor disruption piece to which she said there must be a strike in front of my home. I told her there is no such thing. I asked if it could be due to construction in front of my place, she said that must be it. The thing is, the construction does not obstruct my place. She said that another attempt will be made next business day. I said would this not be an issue if construction is there next business day, she said she does not know until next business day to see if there is still construction. I basically told her that I can guarantee that the construction will still be there, so does that mean that as long as there is construction, I will not get my package? She gave some irrelevant response that made me wonder if I was simply talking to a robot. But I now know that she is not a robot because when I asked for a transcript of the chat (to serve as confirmation that she submitted a request for me to arrange for pickup instead), she became defensive and snarky. At one point she even said ""I will be a few more minutes as I keep having to reply to you"". Who says that? You're basically telling your supervisor that you cannot multi task. After all this, I still don't know what will become of my package. She submitted the request, gave me a confirmation number and ended the chat without thank you, good bye or can I help you with anything else.

3585,YooJin SHIN,"PLEASE DON'T HAVE PARTNERSHIP WITH PUROLATOR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE CUSTOMERSPurolator is the WORST shipping company!I don't understand why Zara and some other companies are in partnership with purolator. The driver left notice card and the pickup agency was too far from my place. So I asked to change pickup location. And the agent told me I can pick it up on July 3rd. On July 3rd, I tracked the item on the website and it was updated but the item was NOT redirected. So I made a call again and the agent said as I asked redelivery on Friday it could not be redirected. (At this point, if requiring for changing pickup location is not available on Friday, the agent should let me know that when we talk on the phone. Also, according to their schedule, they work on Friday too. Why is it impossible? They just don't want to work) The parcel is for present so I couldn't delay anymore. So I said I am going to pick up at the first pickup location and no need to redirect. Then, the agent said she's going to leave a notice on the system. The next day, July 4th, before leaving I tracked the item on the website again to make sure my item is at the first pickup location. Then, I realized that it's redirected! She said she successfully left notice on the system but now it's at the other place! If I do not check before leaving, I would be on a fool's errand when extreme heat alert is issued. And such sh🤮tty experience is not the first time! I asked changing pickup location for 3 times  last time. Never redirected and was sent to the sender eventhough it was with in 5 holding business days!!!!Companies which have partnership with Purolator should seriously consider to change to other shipping companies like Canadapost if they do not want to lose customers!!!Not only for business but also for an individual, strongly recommend to use other shipping company !NEVER Purolator!Date of experience: July 05, 2018"

Well this one is my favourite - Day #3 comes and they PUT IT ON THE WRONG TRUCK AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I call them outraged, and receive no remedy other than it will be delivered 3 days later on Monday, or I can drive 60 min round trip to their location to pick it up at 10pm. The package arrived 60 HOURS ago and they are located 30 MINUTES from me and haven't been able to deliver this package in 3 DAYS.

The order was supposed to arrive on Friday, but Purolator could not deliver to my apartment, apparently unable to access the front code despite being provided with the buzzer code. This is completely untrue as our buzzer code is directly linked to my phone; I would have received a call if they actually attempted the buzzer code. I did not the receive the call. In addition, Amazon Logistics completed a delivery the day before, fully using the buzzer code. I complained to Amazon about them, who told me that they called Purolator and provided the instructions. We scheduled for the delivery to occur today, Tuesday June 16, the week after. Lo and behold, upon checking my tracking page, Purolator has once again been unable to access my apartment. Because they could not access the front door. Despite the buzzer code being specifically provided to them. Unless there's been an earthquake and the front door is filled in with bricks, that front door is available. Suffice to say, I am extremely disappointed as to how this whole situation played out. Purolator genuinely has been the worst company I've ever interacted with, and I've been interacted with many.

They never leave a notice to prove that they even attempted a delivery and nor do they leave a voice message at our enterphone. When we call and ask them why they did not leave a notice of a failed delivery attempt, then they say that sometimes a driver will not leave a notice for condo owners for our protection. This is just crap and from now on if I ever order something again, I'll make sure to ask which courier they are using. We've never had an issue with other courier services like UPS, Canada Post, etc.Also, now after my wife called them, they said that we have to pick up the parcel from their nearest location which is 10 miles away. Do that in an SUV at today's gas prices, NOT. We will not drive to pick up a parcel that was never attempted to be delivered.

Second thing: I called and told them they did not do their job, so they rescheduled the delivery to the day after ""at the same timeframe"", 10am or so. A litle bit before 6PM the next day, they tell me they will not even ship, rescheduled the next day again. I arranged an address change to my work address, because I cant stay home forever...

Their customer service told me that they don't have that priority. Hey, you just deliver a big TV and don't care if anyone there to receive or not?Second, I receive a notice at 8am that the package will be delivered in the same day. How can i do to arrange my stuffs to stay home and wait for them? The CS agent told me that my responsibility is check it to arrange time. What??? Third, no call before coming. This point, other carrier like UPS, Canada post did it. If the stuff is big and valuable, at least other delivery service call me 30 minutes before they come, make sure I have some one at home to receive or further arrangement. But this service doesn't do that.Fourth, they refuse to give my package to my building manager even I told them do so. When delivery man buzz my apartment door, i told him that I'm not home now, so I can either let him go in first then call the building manager come to receive and open my suite door to put it in, or can he deliver it directly to the manager office. But that guy refuse and only say ""no no no no"" hundred of time. Ok, i understand that a valuable stuff need a signature of someone who is over 18, right? But the building manager is not enough credential? Even she can open the right suite number to let you put the stuff in?Fifth, when I asked that guy if he will arrange another time to deliver )that the way Canada post did) it to me or the package will go to the pick up point.

3614,Teemo,"Horrible service and belligerent repsHorrible service and reps who are antagonistic and customer hostile. Yesterday Purolator left $1100 worth of product in the 3rd floor hallway of my apartment building. That's just sitting in the hallway where any of the other 20 tenants could have taken it (A 43"" computer monitor and a mobile stand). I've called them and they belligerently claim they are allowed to do that and I should take it up with Amazon. Part of the problem is how hostile, righteously indignant, belligerent, rude and unhelpful their reps are. I guess they must get this kind of thing a lot because I'd barely spoken and they were on the defensive loudly. It is no surprise to me that they have 93% one out of five rating here. That's evidence enough for you! 93% bad! I'm in a lockout building. How is the delivery agent bypassing the lockout to get in? Purolator has said the local dispatch will call me and they don't. This is NOT an Amazon problem, this is a Purolator problem. Amazon are not the ones gaining access to a lockout bldg and then leaving things sitting in the apartment hallway. This is the second time in a week.   PLEASE NOTE: for others facing this problem with Amazon shipments. Phone Amazon and ask to have Purolator de-prioritized on your account. This means Purolator will only be used as a last resort - still too much in my opinion. One star is too high a rating for this garbage company who cares nothing about their customers.RE Catherine's replay:You said""If the driver is let in the building that would usually require a code and/or a key,""Did you read the OP? He wasn't let into the building. Myself and bldg management reviewed the lobby security footage today from yesterday. What the Purolator driver did was grab the door as it was closing from someone else who had been buzzed in. He knows that he is not supposed to enter unless he's buzzed in. I reported all the info including describing the video footage to Purolator. Purolator again promised a local manager will get back to me. My bldg manager is putting the video on a USB for me so I will have that available.As far as contacting you at your bs email. Why? For one more layer of obfuscation and bureaucracy. Get your company to do the initial thing they promised  and that is to have the local manager to get back to me. UPDATE: The regional manager finally called. She was a defending her driver's actions of entering the bldg without being let in by me. She eventually just ended the call in my mid sentence saying have a good day and just hanging up.I called her back and she had a little petulant flip out on the phone. She was more interested in being right than actually solving the problem. All you gotta do folks is look at their 93% one star ratings here.

As you can see from all these reviews, this courier is a joke; they lie about the delivery status of your package, presumably to meet their quotas for the bosses at Canada Post. Canada Post should terminate this entire joke of an operation.Date of experience: May 30, 2018"
3621,Tien-Dat Le,"I would give 0 star if possible!One client of mine needs few banner stands for his trade-show in Saskatoon. I scheduled the shipment ""Next Day"" and ""Air-shipped"". The pick-up guy came and he promised up and down, left and right that it would be at the destination 10AM next day.2 days later, the customer sent us an email telling us that the shipping is still in transit and his show was happening at the time of the email. I checked on Purolator and yes, the package is still somewhere on the way. Purolator told me that they sorted the package in ""GROUND"", freaking ""GROUND"", which takes 3 days for the stuff to come. I still have my copy here and it was ""AIR"". Why did they choose the ""Ground"" themselves? Did nobody check on the waybill before sorting?The customer is really mad and he came to the show with nothing to present his business. I don't know what to say but Purolator really needs to look at their services. It's not the way to do business at all.Date of experience: May 30, 2018"

3623,TSaokei,"Purolator or is it Poor-or-later?Driver made a single attempt to deliver item (CCTV video confirms this). Left a pick up note which said the item would be available to pick up the next day. I went to get the item the next day and the item was not there.  Using the web site's tacking and emails I was told the item was again out for delivery. I again went out of my way for this company by ensuring someone would be at the delivery address to receive the item. Instead I get another tracking update saying I could go and pick up my package.When I order a delivery I expect it to be delivered to the address. I never have to go over a kilometre to pick up my delivery pizza.  If there is no answer for the pizza guy, he'll call the house (in other words he'll make an effort).  I don't get dropped off blocks away from my destination when I use a taxi service.Avoid bossiness' offering shipping via Purolator.

I live in newfoundland, and every single time something is coming via purolator, the package tracks as far as dieppe, NB and no updates after that. Its very annoying.  Almost pointless to have a tracking number, isn’t it? Whats happening with my parcel? Won’t know til whenever it actually shows up. In this day and age, literally every other courier can give you updates so you can follow where your parcel is day to day and be prepared, but with purolator your always left wondering....where is my parcel right now? will it arrive when they say it will? The day before? The day after? It’d be nice to know for sure, wouldn’t it? Isn’t that purolators job?  I’m currently waiting like a fool all this morning because AMAZON says my stuff will be delivered today, and as far as the purolator tracking info goes, nothing to report since May 17, when it left NB (today is May 22), should arrive “by tomorrow”.

3633,Rachel,"Worst shipping company ever!Worst shipping company ever!! On a previous package, Purolator has stated they ""attempted to deliver"" my package but they never actually came because we did not have an attempted delivery slip. We requested the package be sent to a retail shipping location for pick up. We went there the next day, and surprise! The package was not there. We called Purolator, and they said it was at another location that we did NOT request, so we told them keep it there and we will go the next day. When we arrived the next day, the package wasn't there! They had somehow delivered to the previous shipping location we originally requested. If they tell you ""2 business days to update"" they really mean ""we'll screw it up two more times, so you'll actually get your package a week later."" What kind of delivery company has you pick your package at some far away location?? I wish Amazon never had the option for Purolator! I have NEVER had a good experience with this company. If you have the choice, do NOT choose this company!I am unfortunately waiting for another package, and they will once again, undoubtedly screw it up. I will have to travel 40 minutes to pick up my ""delivery"" because I can't trust them to deliver it to the correct retail shipping location. Thanks so much Purolator!! At least you are consistent in screwing up in your line of business!Edit: James, there is no point in telling you the tracking number.

First they ask me to check the tracking record to confirm if it was delivered to the right address even though I told them it wasn't, no one at my household saw or picked up the package from the door. I have already checked the tracking record on both Amazon and their site, on theirs it claims it was delivered to me on Amazon it says it was given to someone in Scarborough. The staff person said that their drivers originate from Scarborough which isn't true in this case they came from Vancouver. I showed them screenshots of both records to prove it. In the end they claim the gps shows that the driver did indeed send it to the right address and decided to close my case without offering further help. Despite the evidence I provided that a stranger has my stuff and the personal info that's labeled on my package. I was only contacting the company to leave feedback, I appreciate that they tried to look into it but they provided really poor customer service.

3660,Abbey Colucci,"A review of Purolator (April 2018)This review will make no difference to Purolator, but maybe it will make a difference to you, dear person who is considering using Purolator because they might be cheaper or because they're the Canadian choice. Please, dear reader, head my warnings. We ordered tricycle through Toys R Us as an Easter present for our tot. Purolator left delivery note April 3. I knew from the moment I saw that Purolator was involved, there would be trouble. So, husband called April 4 and was told redelivery would be April 6 between 8 am and 6 pm and that delivery driver may or may not leave the package on the porch if we leave a note. We did tape a note to the door to leave the box on the porch, but we were also home waiting for the package. We waited for 10 hours and there was no delivery, though on the Purolator tracking site the bike was picked up at 5:30 pm. I called April 7  and customer service said we must have misunderstood because there was no way they could have guaranteed delivery on Friday as they need 2 BUSINESS DAYS for a redelivery request. That's right, 2 business days to send the request from the national call centre to the local. Delivery was then set for Monday, April 9 between 8 am and 6 pm. The note remained on the door and husband stayed home waiting, but of course, there was no delivery. We have now been waiting 20 hours at home for a box. Called at 5:30 pm and was told there was no way they could deliver by 6 pm and that we would need to wait between 8 am and 8 pm on April 10 to get the package, but they *might* be able to upgrade our shipping to the morning. Oh, wait, that probably couldn't happen because it was so late in the day they couldn't possibly communicate that information to the driver because they needed the aforementioned TWO BUSINESS DAYS to communicate to the local company. Unlike every other shipping company in the world, they also can't provide even a rough estimate of delivery time, just a timespan of 10-12 hours with you waiting by the door like some sad dog. And that's what you are to Purolator, a sad dog waiting by the window. Since I couldn't guarantee we would be waiting by the door for another 12 hours, I canceled the shipment (which would be a total of 32 hours, btw).There was no recompense offered other than a half-hearted apology and two people saying ""What do you want me to do?"" and ""I can't take the blame"" (literally said that to me). Soldiers fighting in the Civil War got mail faster than Purolator can deliver packages. Donald Trump is more honest to his constituents than Purolator is with their customers. Doug Ford cares more about the inner city than Purolator cares about its customers.  Westboro Baptist Church has more respect for gay people than Purolator does for its customer base. If your business does shipping with Purolator, you are saying to your customers you don't care about them and they can go f*** themselves because you're just grabbing their money and leaving.The inefficiency and impotence of the entirety of this company has left me so bemused I have found the experience quite hilarious, but really just want to prevent you from having this experience.Date of experience: April 10, 2018"
3661,J.R.,"Incompetence EmbodiedIt's a stretch to call Purolator a ""delivery service."" They'll leave a ticket at your door after one (alleged) delivery attempt, then you'll have to drive 30 minutes to an hour to go pick it up. But that's not all! You can call them to reschedule a delivery for your package, and then they'll give you an EIGHT HOUR delivery window, after which they STILL WON'T DELIVER YOUR PACKAGE. Then you'll have to call them back to try and get your package delivered AGAIN, but you'll find out your package is ""still on a truck somewhere"" and you'll have to wait another two days before they'll attempt to deliver it, at which point you'll be suspicious that you'll ever get your package at all. Which is what happened to us. After 30 TOTAL HOURS of waiting for scheduled delivery, and after multiple phone calls with Purolator's ""customer service,"" during which we were told multiple, contradictory excuses about why they seem unable to put a box in a truck, drive the truck to an address, and leave the box on a doorstep, we gave up and told them to cancel the order.Purolator is a true marvel: a delivery service that is incapable of delivering a package. Bottom line: if you order something and see it's assigned to Purolator, CANCEL YOUR ORDER and use UPS, Fed-Ex, Postal Service, DHL, ANYTHING BUT PUROLATOR.

You pay for shipping to your door and you still have to go and pick it up at a store because they don’t want to stop at the house to see if you are home.

3664,Curtis,"2 day shipping is really 5 day shippingOrdered an item with two day shipping , attempted delivery yesterday (Friday) missed the courier by 10 mins. Tried calling customer service on hold more than 15 mins when the wait queue message advised less than 5 mins. No option was given for a call back , hung up and called the local store. They advised that due to my missed delivery on a Friday I have to wait until Monday in the afternoon to pick up my package. What was the point of paying the extra money for express shipping when now it turns into 5 days , biggest money grab ever! Plus only one attempt to drop off a package what poppycock. I realize complaining won’t fix anything as any review outlet on the internet shows how bad they are. Next time I will go through Canada post at least they have yet to fail me (weird since Purolator is owned by Canada Post). End rant.Date of experience: April 07, 2018"

Ordered the present for my boyfriend's birthday Five days ago and chosen a two-day shipping, I don't know why somehow it says can only get here today, on the day of his birthday. I waited all day at home just to get the delivery; the delivery person did not even enter the building because he does not know the buzz code, he did not even try to contact me or to get any information from the building manager(which he will always let in the Carrier) and he just left. I contact the customer service and offer the buzz code but they told me he could only return tomorrow or I can pick it up in myself( which takes more than 1 HOUR to bus there).

3679,T.B.,"EgregiousOn March 1, 2018, The licensing board that I am associated with was suppose to send an important document of mine to Michigan Licensing Board in Lansing and decided to use Purolator to courier my document. This licensing board put the ""wrong address"" and Purolator was unable to deliver the document (which is strange because I had another document sent to the very same address and FedEx was able to deliver without any problems). Anyways I called Purolator on March 8 to give the Overnight address to send this important document and they told me how they have to email UPS the change of address and UPS will let them know between 24-48 hours of an update. From March 9 to this date I've been on the phone regularly with Purolator and they promised to update me with the status of my document. When I looked on the tracking of my document, it was sent from Lansing, Michigan to Kansas City, MO on March 14. Nobody from Purolator told me my document was going to Kansas City, MO and wasn't able to give me an explanation as to why my document was sent to Kansas City so I called UPS to gain further information. UPS told me over the phone that the document was sent to Corporate Goods location out in Kansas City, MO because the address was wrong and they keep goods with the wrong address in the warehouse in Kansas City. Upon hearing this information I became enraged as I already told Purolator the Overnight address. I do not understand why it is taking Purolator so long to send my document from Toronto, ON to Lansing, MI when FedEx was able to do this in less than 24 hours. I spoke to Lisa from the International Department who told me Diane was looking into this and there was an investigation going on however when I spoke to Mark from Corporate Customer Relations he told me that my investigation has been closed. I told him how displeased I was with this service(I spoke to a Manager name Donna on March 14 and she told me Diane would get back to me on March 15 regarding the verdict of my document and I wasn't called by either her or Diane) and threatened to have FedEx retrieve my document out in Kansas since its so hard for Purolator/UPS to deliver a document to Lansing, Michigan. Mark then told me that someone made a mistake with the labeling of my package and said that is why it went out to the Corporate Goods site out in Kansas City. He told me Diane the specialist is supposed to get back to me 4:30 p.m. I was better off driving from Toronto to Lansing to pick up my document and deliver it, I atleast know it can be delivered on the same date.People please do not use Purolator to send any important documents, the customer service is egregious and you're better off having FedEx deliver your documents from Canada to the USA or even Canada Post. What disturbs me is that I have to be the one contacting Purolator regarding my document, these folks don't take the initiative to call their customers to update them about their documents being mailed out. Had I known this trouble occurred I would've opted for regular mail. I really wish I can give them a rating less than 1.Date of experience: March 16, 2018"

My belief is that all these customer nonsatisfaction is absolutely preplanned and intentional and they keep doing it at a very frequent rate, based on the complaints tweeted almost every 30 minutes, because they are sure they can get away with it, since the customer is in a helpless position. The worst part is they are so bold to respond to each customer with an apology note to no avail which to me looks more like a mockery rather than customer care! If they cared one bit for their reputation, let alone the customers, they wouldn’t allow such a mass outpour of complaints.As for me, I placed an order with Costco 16 days ago (the delivery estimate was 7-10 days) and unfortunately Costco trapped me with Purolator. I was just hoping not to be as unfortunate as others but after this long period of waiting, I have realized that I have also fallen victim to the nasty game Purolator is playing with its customers. After waiting for the initial 14 days for the shipment to arrive to my town based on the tracking update, they start playing their game and giving lame excuses by leaving a message on tracking that “the item is heavy to be delivered, contact us!”, as if Purolator has never delivered a 50 Kg shipment or they never knew, since they picked up the shipment 9 days ago, that it was heavy! Since then I have called them 4 times and every time they give me a new story, 1st they say if you are at home 1 pm onwards we will deliver it today and wait for the driver’s call, then they say it will not be delivered today but the driver will call you today for sure, 3rd time they say NO the driver will call you tomorrow, 4th time I call the following day after not hearing from them, they say the driver will call you in 48 hours and so on…., and based on other customers reviews, I have to make sure to stay at home all the time not knowing when the driver is going to call or come for a sneaky ring and “run off” like most customers have experienced.And the sad part is I do not know for how long more I have to wait for the driver’s call and the call center is not even providing me with the depot’s phone number so that I can contact them, for the very obvious reason that they want to buy time and know their game very well.Even with the tracking messages they are so unprofessional that they repeated the tracking message “Arrived at sort facility”, today, 21 hours after first posting the exact same message yesterday!

3702,Mario T,"This is the worst Courier Service ever…This is the worst Courier Service ever for sure.I have been waiting at home for an item to be delivered all day and I have been keeping a track on it on their website and also the app.Today, after 1:00 pm, I decided to contact them directly using Live Chat and was told then that the Item would be delivered until 6:00 pm today.A little past 4:00 pm, I checked the status again and was baffled to see that it was marked with ""Attempted delivery at 12:30 pm"".Contacted them by phone only to be told that the driver attempted the delivery, which he did not, and that he might be able to try to deliver it again later today. No specific time as it can be delivered until 8:00 pm.This is definitely the worst Courier I have ever dealt with, and this is not the first time it happens.On another occasion, I saw the Purolator truck stop in front of my building while I was on my balcony and the driver only took a notice with him to stick on the door. I ran to the door but it was too late and I was forced to go and pick-up the item at the drop-off location.This is the type of company that does not deserve to be in business as they charge their clients for a specific delivery method and then they just do as they please. What a joke of a company...And, unfortunately, I am forced to give them 1 star in order to have this posted.Date of experience: February 21, 2018"
3703,Gerald Prud'homme,"To call Purolator a courier service is…To call Purolator a courier service is a wild exaggeration! You're better off sending your package by regular mail. They just don't care about the customer. They ring the door bell and leave within 30 seconds, and you are left to scramble to get your package redelivered. You schedule a new delivery time with them, but they don't show up. Worst of all, you may have to go and pick it up yourself at their central office, located in the middle of nowhere. Do yourself a big favour, don't use Purolator, and don't order anything delivered by them. Update of our last adventure (not yet over): 2 full days of failed delivery. Here are some of the excuses I've had from them over the last 2-3 years: Mechanical failure; the driver was sick; bad weather. I'm sure they have many others. Conclusion,  I will have to pick up extremely important documents at one of their locations., at the last possible minute. If anyone is happy with their services, they must have angels working for them!Date of experience: February 20, 2018"

I’ve called purolator several times but just like their delivery drivers, their customer service representatives are equally incompetent. I rescheduled for a delivery that im expecting today but unable to track it and have no idea if it’s on the truck. I just got off the phone with purolator and again they couldn’t help(not a surprise). Am I expected to just sit at home all day and wait for my package which might not even come today? I’m unable to pick it up at the facility because I don’t have a vehicle so delivery is the only option. What’s the deal purolator? Clearly you don’t give a sh#t bout your customers because all I see on any review site are bad reviews regarding your delivery system. After I post this some bullsh#t customer rep will say “send us your tracking number so we may help”. No...no you won’t and you can’t.Date of experience: February 20, 2018"

3707,Peter Jeffery,"My parcels not delivered due to…being stored by Purolator for 5 days in a downtown ... storage unit?!My parcels not delivered due to 'weather delay' ...without any foul weather on the delivery date it was reported.  This happens  repeatedly, on multiple deliveries on multiple dates.   Of greater concern - after having received literally hundreds, or in excess of 1000 deliveries from UPS, Fed Ex, Canada Post and Purolator ... they do not deliver to me about 10% of the time or more due to my address being listed as incorrect.   I can see the address, and it is correct, and my house has not floated off into the forest.  So, there must be another problem?  Currently, I have yet another Purolator ‘incorrect address’ package sitting in a storage space (of all the dirty places) downtown.  The package contains cereal.   Do I really wish to possess an Amazon delivery after hearing it's been sitting in some storage unit downtown  (given the usual rodent concern in these places, esp. considering the edible contents of my packages).  I will not be picking this up. Meanwhile, another package for my business is two days late and tracking shows no real reason why.   Enough already.Update today:   Another day, and 4 or 5 packages that never made it off the truck.  By the way, I've had friends who have been delivery drivers for Purolator.   I DO NOT blame the drivers.   The company apparently is very poor to work for and I'm guessing there's a high turnover of delivery personnel.    My ""latest' package  (1 of several expected today).   Current time is 9:41pm.   I waited home all day for this.   The delivery includes equipment for my work.

Delivery was initially estimated to be today (Feb 16, 2018) , but now marked for Feb 20, 2018 due to ""Weather delay - service will resume weather permitting"". There is no inclement weather anywhere across Canada between Edmonton and Toronto right now. Based on other reviews of the same nature, I'm suspecting something is currently ""rotten in Denmark"". Transparency is a tool that builds trust in a business, its people, and it's processes - it would behoove Purolator to utilize this tool.

I promptly call Customer service to ask for a same day reattempt and to please use the buzzer (my full name is listed) and they said they cannot contact drivers (what?). They also informed me that they could try to get in touch with the office to get it out for delivery the next day, but it wasn’t a guarantee. The following day.. today. I wait around for the call.... my phone rings ONCE. By the time I pick it up, they’ve hung up, again, no chance of having a reattempt. I work for another big courier company, so I understand the pressures of having to deliver quickly, but I also understand customer satisfaction is extremely important. What’s the point of even having a delivery company that literally and figuratively does not deliver? This courier did the least they could do to get me my package on time.

After my first review, purolator reached out to me to solve the situation but honestly it hasn’t been solved at all. They were unable to find my package and now I find out that ‘personal belongings’ cannot be reimbursed because they need receipts of all purchases as proof. All my belongings in that box were bought in the last year or so, you really expect me to have all the receipts? Now please don’t tell me it’s clearly printed in the terms and conditions because even if it was, it should be the first thing the store employees should inform to the customer, which I wasn’t informed about. Of course!Plus, I had to contact ups and follow up with them and connect them to purolator to restart the investigation. Basically I did the work for them, perfect! And now I’m stuck. No package  in hand, paid for it - ain’t getting that money back, and if I do file a claim, no guarantee ( the lady in the claims department said 100%) that I won’t receive any compensation for my time and money spent, along with mental trauma communicating with these people.

IT COULD SAVE YOU TIME/MONEY/FRUSTRATION.Not everyone reads these reviews but the way this company is run only serves to never have my business again. I will walk to a store before I buy something online that says Purolator ""delivers"" it. And I have to put quotes around deliver because words like ""delivery"", ""responsible"", ""guarantee"" are jokes. Meaningless words. Or more accurately, bold faced lies. I am going to quote a review from Jason Pugh - ""I will NEVER use Purolator ever again. This operation is run by incompetent liars. Citing a snow storm from 1.5 week ago as reason to stop delivering today at 4:34. Said it was ""bad weather"" on the nicest day so far of 2017. Paid extra to have package GUARANTEED to be delivered today. If the lazy, lying, incompetent driver was too lazy to finish then maybe he should be fired. PATHETIC!""Why quote this? Because if you do read my review, do your research and confirm what kind of company this is (I would call them a garbage company but my trash actually gets picked up). They ""lost"" my last order, so the company I ordered from replaced the order with a guarantee delivery of January 3 2018 to Fredericton NB. The package left Dieppe (about a 2 or 3 hour drive to Fredericton, give or take) at 0600. The package was then in transit to Fredericton from Dieppe but at 1900 (an hour from their latest delivery time), after spending hours waiting for this delivery I got an update saying they couldn't deliver due to the bad weather conditions. The reasons I am giving so many details is when Jason gave his review, he got a reply saying ""oh the weather was bad, we couldn't do our job"" but Jason made it sound like the weather was quite fine, in fact. So check for yourself. Fredericton weather/Dieppe weather (New Brunswick) for the date of January 3, 2018 and see for yourself the terrible weather conditions that forced them from their deliveries. I am also being specific because today, January 4, 2018, we are expecting a blizzard sometime in the afternoon (the forecast made no indication of any poor weather for the 3rd and was very specific to Jan 4). As of now (0945), it's still a really nice day. So does Purolator stop deliveries because of the weather, tomorrow? ""Too bad. Can’t deliver your package today. Supposed to snow tomorrow"".  I think Jason said it right. Laziness. The weather was fine yesterday and this is inexcusable behavior. If you employ lazy, useless people, then try to blame it on the weather, eventually someone is going to come by and clearly call you out on your actions. This is intolerable and I will make sure as many people know about this kind of service. And this won’t be the only place I leave this review/complaint. Bottom line, you take people's money and do not deliver on your promises. They likely lied about Jason's storm when he said it was clear, but I won’t let them lie about mine. You have the info. Do the research if you have doubts. It might cost you more than money if you don't. What a waste of time. For me, never again.EDIT: Because I feel transparency is important, I am behooved to mention that this actually happened again. Same city. Same courier. Same excuse. Natural disaster or weather related delay for the date of Jan 31/2018. And to make things easier for everyone ""time and date"" (all one word) .com has a neat feature where you can look up historical weather for specific cities, on specific dates. Let's take a look, shall we.So from 0600 to 1200, weather shows as ""passing clouds"". Gosh, do you think the driver has a fear of clouds? Nah, that is just stupid. Obviously the perilous weather that prevented them from doing their job happened later in the day. As a responsible company with customers that they ensure are taken care of and knowing all the work they do to maintain public trust, we can be sure there was some kind of awful, unmanageable weather condition that just could not be handled and we cant blame them for that. So what was it? Hurricane? Blizzard? Flood? Wrath of God?Weather from 1200 to 1800, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Wednesday, January 31, 2018....""Sunny"".Date of experience: February 01, 2018"

Purolator delivery person buzzed me, the call was disconnected even before I can buzz him in. I was expecting for him to call back so I can actually buzz him in but he didn’t. I get an email saying that they’ve missed me. SERIOUSLY. He did not leave any notices or anything anywhere. Called purolator and asked if I can just pick it up myself. They said they’re not sure and most likely it’ll have to be the next day. I advised them of what had happened and told me that they are sure that these drivers try their best to deliver the packages. YEAH, sure he tried he didn’t even try calling again and just left. I dislike purolator and their service over all. Not very helpful.

Sent an extremely important package through overnight shipping. Was assured it would be there by 5pm the next day. It was 17 hours late. This resulted in a cost of a few hundred dollars to me, and time off work to resolve the issue. I spoke with customer service as soon as the issue was identified but they took no responsibility for delay and failed to provide any sort of compensation. Individuals and businesses use this service because they require packages to be at a certain place by a certain time. Failure to take any accountability for that commitment is a failure on behalf of the company's core mandate.Update: It is clear that the reply Purolator puts up in response to posts on this site is a standard response. They ask you to contact them directly so that they can get the package number and look into what's happening. This makes it look like Purolator is addressing the issue: they are not. As noted in the post above, I spoke directly to a customer service rep as soon as the issue was identified and was informed, in no uncertain terms, that they wouldn't do anything.

3755,Kam Orth,"""Delivery"" company lolI have been waiting a week for 2 day shipping from Amazon. My buzzer finally rang and in the time it took me to buzz open the door and get down a single flight of stairs (a few seconds at most) the driver and truck were both nowhere to be seen. A few minutes later the tracking status changed to failed and I had to get on the phone to customer service to find out what was going on. The call centre informed me that it would be Monday at the earliest that I would be able to either have it redelivered or dropped off somewhere else for me to pick up because it would be going back to Nanaimo (hours drive away, and we can't drive due to disability anyway) for the weekend. After calling the Nanaimo office (and hitting a random staff extension as they don't have a secretary or customer service rep apparently) I was lucky enough to get someone who was willing to call the driver on his phone and ask him to try again. I needed this stuff 3 days ago, I DEFINITELY need it this weekend, and I was there to receive it. I am FUMING at the run around this has caused. If I'm lucky, the driver might have time to try to deliver it again today, otherwise I might be able to get a ride from a friend to pick it up tomorrow. If the driver had waited 10 seconds at the door no one would be having to deal with this, but apparently that is too much to expect. UPDATE - Apparently leaving it with their agent here in town was too much and I have to wait until Monday anyway. Another failed delivery attempt email too, despite not even buzzing and giving us absolutely no way of knowing he was here at all. This is the most pathetic service I received from any company ever.Date of experience: January 20, 2018"

Customer service tells me that policy is that it has to go to a depot 400kms away and be re-labeled?. Is this the only location where somebody knows how to write because they sure cant seem to be able to read here.

I went online and the tracking said ""Delivery attempt was made - receiver unavailable"". I called them the next day and rescheduled the delivery for the day after, and the same situation happened. There is no way we couldn't hear the bell or knock at the door, since i spend the whole day in the living room where the entrance is. ALSO, I NEVER EVER missed a Canada post mailman and FedEx delivery. It makes me wonder if purolator delivery guy even bothered to come with my package. He probably did not want to carry the heavy item and instead wanted to make me pick it up myself at the depot. Also, the customer service is no help. They are rude and won't bother doing anything or contacting the driver(I was wondering maybe he got the wrong address), they just offered me a redelivery, BUT I CAN'T STAY HOME 3 DAYS IN A ROW WONDERING IF THE DELIVERY GUY WILLL ACTUALLY COME.

The package has been scanned into the Fredericton terminal this morning, at which point the error was noted. The package will be forwarded to Saint John over the weekend and the delivery is expected to be done on Monday, January 15th.To answer your question you had mentioned on your review regarding compensation, Purolator’s Guaranteed Refund Program covers shipments that were sent with the Express service, but unfortunately not shipment sent with the regular ground service. As the shipment was sent with the regular ground service, a refund for the shipping costs would not be available.-At first I assumed it was a joke, how grossly incompetent does a shipping company have to be? No, unfortunately I have to wait until Monday, while crossing my fingers and hoping they didn't somehow further mess anything up or break the package.Funny thing happened though, I got an apology from amazon.ca this morning before Purolator.

I actually trusted they were trying to locate it and send it.Once they lose it, they do not call you. It's up to you to figure out who to call. I have had 3 different agents all end up not responding to me once they got tricky questions like. ""Is the address now clear. It was provided on Dec 30 - two days after the package was supposed to be delivered"" Whatever you do, don't assume they can deliver. Don't assume they will truthfully display that they were contacted to update the address.Once questions start getting asked, they remove the tracking so you know nothing.If they lose a package, expect their customer tracking agents to avoid you. They cannot even get answers to basic questions like ""where is the package?"" ""Can you tell me whether the clarification of the address has been understood."" ""Why is the package still sitting at the depot after one and a half weeks after the address was clarified again."" ""Is the package lost"" ""Are you getting another company to deliver the package."" Once you start asking these simple questions, they stop contacting you after telling you to wait.Apparently, if they don't understand an address because it is not exactly like the USA or Canada, you are not going to get delivery. They apparently, have limited knowledge of international addresses, Google maps, or basic geography. So if you have to courier internationally, DHL has been recommended.

3780,Kat,"Rude CSPackage was supposed to be redelivered as I missed it the day before. Instead they left it for pick up in another part of town and never left me a slip for the second time in a row. When I called CS the man was very rude or just had terrible phone manner. Of course I accidentally slipped and said ""because purolator f***ed up"". Which, is my fault and I was sorry I said a swear word.. He got really huffy about it, when I tried to apologize for saying the F word he just kept interrupting me. Then was very condescending, inquired why I did not want to take an almost 30 minute bus ride in -30 degree weather to pick up a 20 pound package. While continuously interrupting me while i tried to answer. I have worked CS for a decade, and I get that I said a 'bad word', but to be talked down to like a child for 10 minutes afterwards?

Amazing right? A buzzer code to be able to leave a notification in the reception just as all the other carries (and even Purolator when they want to do it)I realized about this issue because I first reached Amazon since the seller unfortunately sent the package through Purolator.AVOID this company, no criteria people working on this company, so far Canada Post is the best.Date of experience: January 05, 2018"

We were in the living room at this time watching a movie and by the time I read my email it was 1:00pm. I heard no doorbell. I phoned customer care right away and they said they will call me back before end of day. I asked why they didn't doorbell? She confirmed there's a note SRO on the order...(no idea what that means). Anyway I think with many instances where packages are stolen on front porches these days they shouldn't safe drop parcels at front door. At least doorbell when someone is expecting a package they will be waiting for it like I did. I've waited since dec 26. To get this package and why the holdup? Should the customer be put up to this? I made the purchase off the retailer and purolator is the trusted courier. If instances like these should occur then why bother shipping to home. I could have just opted for store pick up? At least rest assured I will be getting my commodity. I am not truly impressed right now. I have purchased a lot online from the same retailer shipped to my home and all I can say this is the first time this happened to me. Anyway received a follow up cal from Donna to advise they will phone meBack tomorrow to confirm if the truckers gps had some error of some sort. I really hope my package shows up.

I have a house guest who came for Christmas who is now days late getting home (8hrs away) because her departure depends on receiving this package. She is understandably very upset. The only information I've been able to get from Purolator is that the package was given to a local agent and should have arrived by now. They are supposedly looking into it and will get back to me ""by the end of the day"". Totally unacceptable.

Proving once again that they just fill the pickup depots and cannot be bothered coming to the door.   Yes I was foolish enough to wait Monday and Tuesday in hopes of an actual delivery. Laugh is on me I know and I waited until today so as not to take my frustration out on anyone not deserving of it.. Of course the tracking details are a joke and the drivers think they have their entries down to an art. Oh Yes, delivery was attempted and a time is pulled out of whatever and entered as a fact which it is not. Most likely why so many of us see the trucks stopped in any given area on any day for long periods of time. They need only go thru the parcels they have no intention of actually delivering and mark them attempted. I would really like to know if any dispatch or supervisor actually looks at any completed daily route to compare actual times claimed by a driver. Why is it that a courier company that is based on deliveries has such a bad reputation for not delivering? Gee, could it be that they have become just a lazy transfer company, taking from depot to depot and cutting out ""to the door delivery""? Funny enough we are located in an apartment building and if the driver had actually stopped, he would have found me right there waiting for him at the main entrance! He would not have had to do anything more than pull in our parking lot. But of course how was he to know that we were anxiously waiting for the package? How silly that we did not specify that we truly did want TO THE DOOR DELIVERY. I am going to give the driver the benefit of the doubt and believe the package was received in Regina on Monday, December 4th at 10:23am for delivery in Swift Current and was also at the parcel depot in Swift Current for pickup at 10:08am Tuesday, December 5th. But where oh where was it for 21 hours (allowing 2.5 hrs highway travel time) between leaving Regina and arriving at the pickup depot? Yes it was time sensitive. I did try to speak to Purolator this morning regarding this issue via live chat but their representative Karen L referred to the tracking details and basically called me a liar. Through all this I did not share that we are a business.

3818,R. Y.,"Anyone has any suggestion on how to get your package as you plan by using Purolator?This is my first experience with Purolator and also my first time to write review. Sometimes we can not choice delivery company and I want to know if anyone has experience to get package on time with Purolator. I request a express evening service in Nov. 29 because I could not stay home during the day. I want to be sure I get the package in Nov.30. The tracking web page showed my package was on delivery between 5:30pm to 9pm in Nov. 30. But package was delivered at 2:40pm. I talked with the driver and he offered to wait 5min and also told me there is not evening delivery instruction. Obviously I could not get home in 5min. I want to apologize to the driver sine my attitude might not be good because I could not get my package. I call the customer service at 4pm and she sent a request for Dec. 4 evening delivery. I also filled out a request in Dec. 1 in company's website and asked for help to make sure I could get my package in Dec. 4 in the evening which I never got an answer. I had a very busy schedule and two important meeting in Dec. 4. So I chatted with an agent before I left for work in the morning and got an answer that I should get my package in Dec. 4 although the tracking did not show that it was on delivery. I chatted again with an agent at noon and found out my package would deliver in Dec. 5. I was stressed and frustrated because I was afraid that it would be too late after I get the package. So I decided to take 4 hours to pick it up myself and asked if it would be available for me to do that. The warehouse hours was sent to me and I was told I should be able to pick up before 8pm. I checked tracking before I left for picking up and found out the tracking was updated for reschedule delivery. So I called the custom service again and asked her to make sure my package would be available for pick up when I got there between 6:30 to 7pm. She sent a request and told me it should be fine. She also told me I could not reach the warehouse by phone since there is no phone. So I went to the warehouse. I could not pick up my package because it was loaded on truck and he could not tell me what time it would be delivered. I was really panicked because I could not wait at home whole day in Dec. 5. I went to work very early to get some urgent work done and skipped two meetings so I could stay home for sometime. Fortunately I was able to get my package in the morning in Dec. 5. It was not too late for me. I think the company may do not have the service they list or the operation system does not work well. I feel every employee did the job and I feel sorry for them that they have to face custom's attitude.Date of experience: December 05, 2017"
3819,Nicholas Powell,"Worst Company - ever?!THE WORST, most confused company I believe have ever dealt with. I don't normally review anything as I'm a live and let live kind of guy but the standard here was the lowest I have ever seen and felt I needed to warn anyone that was not aware.I cannot believe they are still in business. I arrived at the door about two minutes after initial delivery was attempted. Found the door knocker and contacted customer service immediately, I was told it was not possible to contact driver and have them retry even though it was only 6-9 minutes after the attempt. OK, not great service but I understand. Was told it was available for pick up next day.Went to pick it up (an hour's drive) and was told it had gone out again for redelivery. Drove home and waited only for nothing to arrive. Called customer service next day, Saturday - was told it had been placed on the wrong truck and had not arrived back at the pickup area yet. Was 'promised' delivery would be reattempted on Monday. Monday, waited in again, checked online and it didn't seem to be out for delivery - called customer service again and was told a mistake had been made yet again and they were sorry but ""ABSOLUTELY PROMISED"" redelivery would be attempted the following day, Tuesday.Went online early Tuesday to see the package had gone out for delivery. Relief.Checked back a couple of hours later to see if I could get a better estimate of delivery time only to find it had now been delivered to the pickup area.Totally confused, I called customer service only to be told it was available for pickup.Is this a real company?

Items were shipped separately by Amazon with both items due on the same day.  I've had hundreds of items shipped to my office, never an issue.  Cutting board oil came in as it should.   Cutting board never came in.  Upon checking the tracking number on purolator's site, it complained the company name was missing.  ??????  My name was there, the address was there and the suite number was there.  It is not my company buying the goods, it is me.  I don't put my condo's name when I have things delivered to my home.

3829,Sarah Penpraze,"Why Even Bother?It's really frustrating to have to deal with this company. I've had to do so from two major Canadian cities (Montreal and Ottawa) and the only thing that you can count on, is that the service will be consistently atrocious. Let me first make it clear that I never willingly use this courier service, it is unfortunately the luck of the draw with some online orders.I have never once known of a Purolator delivery person who possesses the ability to ring a doorbell, let alone knock on a door. As far as Purolator is concerned, an attempted delivery means that the delivery person was physically present to toss the delivery slip somewhere near to your front door. If you are incapable of telepathically sensing their presence, well, the fault is obviously the result of your shortcomings. Time and time again, I have had to travel to the nearest Purolator authorized agent location to pick up my packages where I will explain to world weary ears that Purolator, once again, did not deem it necessary to ring on my doorbell while I was at home. A sentiment that they claim they hear multiple times per day. I finally decided that I'd pay for a UPS box so that my packages could be delivered there during their hours of operation. Unfortunately, when it came time for Purolator to actually deliver there, my packages got redirected because Purolator can not deliver to it's competitors; a claim which is simply not true and took lots of time and headaches to rectify. Things seemed to have been going well for nearly a whole season but once again, there seems to be some issue with deliveries to UPS. I attempted to clear this up with the customer care line. The automated IVR estimated a 10 minute wait that was actually half an hour long and the customer representative who spoke to me was condescending, dismissive, unhelpful and inattentive. It was like pulling teeth to get her to open an investigation which I'm convinced she only did in order to get me off of the phone.The following day, I received an email asking for a lot of information about my package including it's contents, a question which is frankly, quite invasive. Two full days have passed without follow up and no time frame was provided. The people that this company hires indicates to me that the company lacks integrity and even the most fundamental work ethic. I hope to one day see that change.Date of experience: December 01, 2017"
3830,Alaa Darwech,"Worst courier system I’ve ever dealt …Worst courier system I’ve ever dealt with. I’ve never had an issue with sending gifts to someone before it was always delivered but Purolator came up with a million issue. First they never contact you on your package’s whereabouts when it ships, you just have to log in frequently or get them to send you an email. They wouldn’t deliver it to the address because they didn’t have the key to the mailbox which every other courier does. After having to redirect the order they sent it to their office so I had to go get it but what’s worse is that they wouldn’t give it to me unless it matched my address but since it’s a gift and was sent to a friend’s address I had to ask that friend to come with me to pick it up. What a lovely way to give a gift right....Date of experience: December 01, 2017"

I received a call 2 days later saying the it had been shipped to Calgary instead of Edmonton and it would arrive on Monday. Ok, not great, but these things happen. When it didn’t show on Monday I called the company I ordered from to get the tracking #. When I looked it up it looked like my package was still in Calgary. So the company I ordered from called to see what the delay was and they were informed that my parcel was on its way. Nope! Still not here. Now I have contacted customer service to find out what’s going on. I was told they would look into and get backl to me ASAP. Haven’t heard a word back, even after I emailed again to check on the status. All I can think now is that my stuff was stolen by an employee or this company is truly incompetent! Now the company I ordered from wont reimburse me until the package is sent back to them, because of course its not their fault and I might be out the $200.00 I spent on my order!!!! What a horrible experience, I will never use this company again and I will always check to see if the goods I am buying online are using them.

3833,Philip Chung,"Many rescheduled Attempts. FrustratingSuppose to receive a package on Nov 27th from Amazon; as each day went by it keep on being reschedule to ship the next day. Frustrating part was I had to be home because they can't leave it in of my apartment door. Normally I don't mind going to pick it up at the local depot but since package weight over 55lbs i prefer to get it delivered to my door.Back Story:Day 1: Nov 27; rescheduled for the next business day.Day 2 Nov 28; rescheduled again never left terminal; contacted help desk; Got escalated to a tracking specialist. Day 3: Nov 29; Rescheduled again never left terminal; Tracking specialist contact me back thru email that the shipment has been push back again till tomorrow. Day 4: Nov 30. Status update: Shipment is on its way; however I was not home to receive the package. No notice of attempted delivery slip as well. Absolute no courtesy call from the delivery truck driver to reschedule to a later time or if they can drop it by with my neighbor/building management. Now the shipment is at local depot. Contacted help desk; got it reschedule again for tomorrow between 8am-6pm; Advised that driver is not issue a company cell phone to provide details for when the shipment will arrive.This has been very frustrating overall. I understand that there will be unexpected delays hence the quote ""estimate delivery date"". But if the driver had taken a look at the previous attempts of reschedule delivery and escalation to a tracking specialist. Wouldn't it make sense to just call the customer on their personal cell phone to check to see what time the customer is available for that day and arrange for a closer delivery time-frame instead of 8 to 6? Isn't it more efficient for both parties? Especially when its come to heavier packages I should give the drivers a benefit of a doubt, maybe they aren't equip with the right tools to view previous delivery attempts and escalation nor are they allow to use personal cell phones to contact customers. I would fairly say from reading all these previous reviews that something has to change. Maybe maybe keeping the customer inform and owning up to the problem and seeing it thru from beginning to the end instead of leaving the customer hanging. Just my 2 cents.I'm not even sure if I'm able to stay at home from 8am-6pm to receive this package.Date of experience: November 30, 2017"

Yesterday, the package failed to arrive due to 'high volume' and the same thing occurred today. Their customer support, the poor souls, are unable to offer any information about when or even IF my package will be delivered. I'm unable to be at home tomorrow, but they will not reschedule the delivery for the weekend, and the item will be sent to pickup location an hour from my home when the delivery fails.I'm not even in a rush to receive packages. I just want the company to make a reasonable commitment in line with their abilities instead of making clearly unachievable estimates andinsisting that I just hope they'll deliver the package. The lack of transparency is infuriating, and I'll be cancelling every amazon order that uses Purolator from here on out.Purolator's unwillingness to take any real action on this has been proven again and again, so I'm not interested in speaking with yet another rep who will fail to change this situation or even to make improvements in the future. I'm only writing this in the hope that someone else will see it and choose not to use this company.Edit* I will not send on my tracking number.

I just cancelled a weekly delivery because Purolator was the only courier available in my area and surprise surprise, not only was the delivery late to the point where they had to deliver it the following day, they ""attempted delivery"" and left without a delivery notice.What kind of delivery service in 2017 does not give their drivers the ability to call the recipient when they arrive?

3867,Brad,"IncompetentI don't know how this company manages to stay in business.  On Wednesday a notice was left on the front door of my home that I'd missed a delivery, and an ""envelope"" was waiting for me at a pickup location that's more than an hour drive in city traffic most of the time.  I didn't know what the envelope was, and the name that the call centre gave me didn't relate to anything I was expecting.  I asked them to transfer the envelope to a closer location, and I would pick it up.  Last night I was called by the pick up location and asked to come right away because the package that has arrived is HUGE and it won't fit inside their business.  It turns out the envelope is a 157lb crate.  In the past when I've had large items delivered the delivery company has called and arranged a time window to drop off the product.  Now Purolator has to pick up the package again (It won't fit in my car) and move it a third time, resulting in extra expense for the company, and delaying the delivery by several days.Date of experience: November 17, 2017"

Received a tracking info at 7:40 am stating that the package is in the truck for delivery to our place.  Since it required a signature I stayed at home to wait for it.  Usual delivery time for most couriers in our area is 2-5 pm.  5 pm rolls in and no Purolator truck.  Called their customer service department and got the same reply.  Yes your package is in the truck to be delivered today by 6pm as per Express Delivery policy.  6pm rolls in no package.  Called them again and agent said yes it is still a go for delivery and they deliver to residences up to 8pm and there is nothing they can do.  Lo and behold at 7:04pm received an email stating that there is a “weather delay”?  What weather delay are you talking about?  There is no speck of snow or drop of rain in Calgary and Canmore and the road in between.  In fact there is no weather or road conditions delay!  I should know as I am the Admin of the FB Group Bow Valley Road Conditions!  What a bunch of liars!  Called their customer service department again and even she cannot explain why the driver will state cannot deliver due to weather delay!  I asked for my package to be re-routed to their drop off point in Canmore and since it is the cut off already for their Depot they won’t be able to do that until Tuesday and I won’t be getting my package until Wednesday!  So frustrating!  And to add insult to injury,  UPS dropped off my other package today at 2pm without any issues.  Purolator is the worst courier ever!

3874,Boots,"This is ongoingThis is ongoing, but never have a felt to be considered a liar as a customer, as the mistakes this company is making with delivery is truly stunning and stressful.  I have taken the step of calling their head office to file a complaint.First they get address wrong, reading it incorrectly, so they wanted me to contact them.  I do so, and given so many reasons why it’s not their wrong doing, so after some hours they get address correct and tell me at least on 4 occasions on my phone and via tracking status online that I will receive my delivery the next day.  Yet less than an hour later whilst not at my home they try to deliver package.  I call them yet again and ask them why they decided to try delivery so soon, but I was told at first there was no such statement made that I would receive package next day, so this really set the tone as this customer was wrong.  They tell me the delivery will be next day.A rental truck pulls up by my home, and pulls away a few minutes later.  I had my front door open in case it was purolator using a rental van.  So after van pulls away I thought it was odd, so checked my tracking and sure enough it was purolator who stated it got delayed for delivery, so it could not deliver item.  The delivery person never got out of van.I am so upset by this and it’s the worst delivery experience I have ever known and I have to wait another week to get my item from them.Disgusting and truly worst way to make a good impression, I will never use purolator again once this is resolved.Date of experience: November 10, 2017"

For me, it was about the School Supplies that I ordered for my children from a School Website, I paid for the delivery and so I am expecting it to be delivered at home. However, I don't think that they have somebody who's delivering stuff in our area as one day I just received a call telling me to call them back; there I have found out that I have to pick it up from one of there office. They told that there was no buzzer code mentioned in the address; however I was totally home and I did not receive any call from the delivery person about the delivery. Common sense, should you are in the way, and there is no buzzer code; call the customer! There I found out that their delivery person are not equipped with one of the essential tool that they should have: A Mobile Phone! C'mon Purolator! I did not mind that first incident.Second, again! My wife a very important document sent from another country where she was previously working. Unfortunately, the local courier's consignee here in Canada is also Purolator. My wife keeps on waiting for a call for the delivery, even visited the condo lobby every now and then to see if there was a sticker on the door for any delivery notice; she did it for one week. After that week, she phone the local courier and found out that it was sent thru Purolator after it arrived n Canada. She had a doubt then that she will be experiencing the same bad service that I had experience with Purolator. She called in the Purolator, and kaboom! they told that the apartment address written on the parcel was wrong, yet why nobody called-in and informed/clarified with her? So we knew that's nothing gonna happen if we are just to wait for them; we decided to have ir dropped to there office again and we will pick it up! Third, when we were at the office; my wife showed a copy of her picture ID! However, the lady on the reception demanded for a document that shows our address; i.e. billing doc, etc. Wow, nobody told her to bring the same when she ask to arranged it for a pick-up. We even clarified with that lady why my wife did not receive a call; and again she confirmed that Purolator's delivery guys doesn't have a mobile phone to call in the customers. Wow again! When we had the parcel we checked the wrong address that they told; there we found out that the wrong address was in the sticker provided by them only. We pointed it out to the lady at the reception; and she did not even apologize for that or provided some sort of empathy to a customer like us who've been experiencing a very very bad service with Purolator. she even insisted that the error is not feom there side. She's was not smiling that could even alleviate what we feel, and just insisted that if we have a complaint; just call in to a certain number.

Oh and this just gets better all the time, I get an email(nov.09) that informs me that the local Manager is going to make sure I get my package today(Nov. 10), well that just makes me feel so special,that the Manager himself is going to handle the delivery of my package. I have to ask myself, Is being a total moron a pre-qualification for getting a job at Purolator?, well it sure seems that way, because I just got a call this morning(nov 10) telling me the package is available for pickup. I ask the person on the phone, what the hell is going on?, I got an email yesterday telling me the manager is going to personally make sure I get my package today. She says well I don't have that information someone in Toronto sent that email, I was like do your departments not speak with each other, someone must have spoken with the manager here in Edmonton you would think. I ask her if she can understand where I am coming from, a frustrated customer who just wants their package, she goes on to tell me they can't control when something goes wrong, like the weather and a break down of a semi-trailer coming from Toronto, to missed connection in Vancouver, to the sort facility conveyor belt breaking down in Edmonton. Inclement weather I can understand, that's an act of god but when your truck and conveyor belt breaks down in succession that's absolutely under your control, its called ""planned maintenance"".She tells me she will speak with the Manager locally and get back to me. I get a call back later, telling me that the Manager has now confirmed he will make sure my package gets to me today at some point, can't be sure when or if it will actually happen today,as they will try and find a truck to put it on.

They supposedly delivered a violin we ordered from Amazon a month ago, which we never received. They did an investigation and concluded that someone took it from our doorstep, where the driver claimed he left it behind our screen door. We get another one delivered from Amazon, and then two weeks later our original violin (which supposedly was already delivered) arrives at our door from Purolator...First delivery almost always fails because of buzzer code issues as well. I try to explicitly call them beforehand on every delivery just to make sure they have my buzzer code and phone number, and half the time the delivery still fails with ""no entry code"" excuse. I've literally have the driver call my phone asking me for the buzzer, and after I give it to him, he never buzzes me and then leaves, with the same ""no entry code"" excuse.

I’ve never encountered such inefficiency and poor communication in my life. I missed first attempt at delivery unfortunately and a note was left on my apartment door without me providing an access code to the building. I rang back to be met by a customer service agent who was insistent that their policy is not to redeliver but that customers arrange to pick up their package. Fortunately I knew my rights and disputed this: after an exasperating conversation she rearranged delivery. I sat at home the entire day: and at 630pm called and was advised my delivery is still in the way. Of course no delivery and no call. I called the next day to be advised there was a “driver emergency”—understandable but inexcusable I sat again for another entire day waiting!! Apparently a case was filed with the proviso that I would rearrange when I’d be home. Of course there was a supposedly blind delivery without my approval, and no card left. I’ve just been called and a message left to pick up my package after I have made arrangements for a specific date!! I’m a busy professional and this is entirely unacceptable!

3887,Ritchie Stirling ,"I've had multiple orders from Amazon …I've had multiple orders from Amazon via Purolator and I'm convinced it is their policy to simply drop deliveries at depots and feign a delivery attempt. I've spent countless days (not hours) waiting in my apartment only to find a notice of ""delivery attempt made"" attached to the wall of the lobby and where I can pick it up. The online service of tracking is also a very inaccurate and duplicitous source of information. And calling will only guarantee you an extremely long wait and indignant response frpm some operator somewhere in the U.S.A. It's all designed to wear you down, give up and just suck it up and go get your own package.I plan to contact each and every seller I deal with on Amazon in the future and if they deal with Purolator,  it's a deal breaker.And notice the response below my review: ""Mike"" from Purolator wants information to ""help"" only after a complaint of multiple bad experiences which are only part of the day-to-day common service. And you can't even rrspond directly. Just like their website tracking and phone service,  it is set up deliberately to make you give up and suck it up.If you Mike or Purolator are really interested, provide me with your number to call.

Online tracking updated around 2pm saying that ""Address correction required - receiver not found"".Now I've had issues with couriers not finding my apartment since it's on top of an office complex. Which is why I always put 'REAR COURTYARD ENTRANCE' in the address line.Speaking to Purolator they tried to pass it off as the driver not knowing what suite I was (it was on the address line) and I called them on their bull**** because my apartment windows FACE the main entrance. No Purolator truck ever came. They kept parroting the same s*** and told me it will arrive Monday, and from the other reviews I see here they'll probably want me to pick it up from their Guelph depot. I live 45 minutes away and have no car.You guys are utter s***, and I bet I'll get the same generic ""oh give me your info and I'll help you out"" message crap they put on here.

Aren't courier companies supposed to be faster than postal services? Not! Not only do they fail on fast delivery, but they do nothing to try to send the package at a convenient time...you have to wait around for almost 12 hours!

My friend gets home from work and there is no package at the door. He emailed Purolator and they ""opened an investigation"". They concluded that the package was delivered to the right address under the OSNR. So they needed to close the case. Well guess what a week since the case was closed a neighbour who lives 3 doors down came and brought the package and found it in her mailbox that does not get checked often. So much for your investigation! This is terrible this company needs better ""Investigation skills"" Because clearly the driver delivered it to the wrong address and it says clearly on the package 510 NOT 516.Date of experience: October 20, 2017"
3895,Kendra Fillingham,"Worst Customer ServiceI have been dealing with Purolator for over 3 weeks and it has been the worst experience. The depot to pick up packages is very far from my house and I do not have a car. I requested via live chat to have my package moved to a pick up location closer to my house but they did not do it. This package was sent to me by my work so I needed ti sooner then later. I also had been using a shipping label from a previous shipment with my name and address on it and was told that was not proof anymore even though I had used it previous week. They claim the policy had changed two days ago but no one told me on live chat today. Three packages were tried to be delivered but the delivery person did not leave a slip a single time. I rented a car and went to pick up on my package and they did not look to see that it was 1 of 2 so I had to rerent a car a go back. The manager was rude to me even though it was Purolators fault. I will never use Purolator again and if I want to order online from a company and they use you I will not order. This has been the worst customer service of my life.

Even their tracking system is a joke, I refreshed the page 3 times over 10 minutes and the 3rd time, the status changed to say that a delivery attempt was made 40 minutes earlier... and that somehow, 4 people sat less than 20 feet from the only door to the house missed the delivery. Even the dog missed the attempted delivery. I don't enjoy being lied to.Most stable adults don't.

I had to send in a video game console across the country to get it repaired and from what it seems, that was perfectly okay. The only problem was THE TRACKING NUMBER DID NOT WORK. This made me insanely paranoid, because from my point of view it hadn't moved in ten days. If that was just a problem in their system then, forgiven.

As all the call centre can say is some time between 8am and 8 pm. I have taken 3 days off work and they never show.  One of the four parcels disappeared so after searching for a week they tell me to file a claim. Next day they try to deliver it. Of course I can't take more time off work now. But why would I take the day off when I filed a claim yesterday.   Once again my order is out for delivery. 7:30 pm and another no show.  I think they don't want to deliver just hang notices on the door so you have to pick it up your self.  Great job for delivery drivers. Refuse to deliver until your customer can't take any more time off work and then leave the delivery slip as they only attempt delivery once.Great work puro, you have the worst service.  Your call centre people just lie to people who call in.  I have been told so many stories (lies) that I do t know what the truth is. My favourite it that you have only one delivery truck in Edmonton.  And the putting you on hold forever to talk to a supervisor who will get it delivered today for the 5th day in a row is very week.

I am told by Purolator that since it is ""Out of their control"" there is nothing they ""can"" (ie read 'WILL"") do about it.

For that price it better come with a back rub and delivered with flowers!   Then when I tracked the package i was told it was delayed due to some ""Mechanical"" issue.  Purolator immediately hide behind that reason as said ""sorry out of our hands but you know....its mechanical""   I raged that for the price i paid they needed to find a way to get me this package.  I was told that it would be impossible because the package would be in some trailer not sorted yet and could possibly sent the next day or 2! It should be noted that i am the primary shipper of the package but will be billed by the shipper from Cranbrook.  I was told I could not get any more info on the package due to this issue.  I spoke with the shipper from Cranbrook BC who was told that the pack would be coming same day and they ""found"" the package and if it was not shipped that evening, the shipping costs would be free.    I leave the gate open of my secluded acreage leaving all yard lights on, garage door open and waited until about 640Pm.  I then decide to take a quick shower only to get out at 648PM to see a tag taped to my door.  ""LOOKS LIKE WE MISSED YOU""   Yes i was explained the policy of signing for packages but this one was a bit hard to swallow.    I find it funny when the company could be out the massive 90 shipping cost if they dont step up and honor their shipment  and magic....package arrives.   Only to leave a tag that will cause me to now drive into a center to pick up the package.    Remember  all this for 90 dollars for a 2 lb package!!!!!!!!!!

The time didn't even match the time of the 'attempted delivery' they put up on the online tracking! And even though there is a Purolator branch downtown where I live in, they took it to one that is 15km away! I do not own a car and I had two take a bus and an Uber to get there (an hour and a half journey).Not only this; when I got there, the lady at the counter refused to give me my package, even when showing my passport and the bill from Best Buy with ALL MY INFORMATION ON IT. She was keen on getting an ID with my canadian address on it, which I obviously DON'T have because I am an exchange student living here for under a year. I even showed her my LEASE with my address on it and she still wouldn't buy it; said it could be 'forged'. A lease is binding to all parties included on it AND it is a LEGAL DOCUMENT. Forging it would result on FELONY.  I know this because I study law, and maybe you should try instructing your workers on it.

It was also a used product totalling almost 100 dollars. The only options I have are to either get another  360, get the right power supply, or somehow get a refund.  I have called numerous EB Games stores and almost no store has the power supply sold separately and no store is willing to exchange for my console since it is with the wrong accessories. I am disappointed with Purolator and will never use this service again. I am demanding financial compensation for this because 1.

I had my first experience with Purolator this year and it started off horrendously, I paid at an express level to get my package shipped within 1-2 days from the Province beside mine to get my package yet they ""missed"" my house 3 days in a row. I called and complained everyday. One of the reps even told me that they have a rule that they can't miss a delivery 3 times, which is when I had to ASK for a refund on the shipping. They couldn't even apologize and offer the refund I had to ASK MYSELF. The number one thing about Purolator is that their customer service doesn't have the word ""sorry"" in their vocabulary. Meanwhile I ordered a package all the way from China a few days later and DHL did a great job getting it to me in 2 days from across the globe.So I finally got my package after many days from Purolator which pushed my sales back.  The next two times were exactly the same. Then the recent one was with my laptop. I had a repair to be done and I couldn't escape from Purolator it was paid for and there were no other options. Once again the ""failed"" to deliver on Wednesday. The next day I was in front of my house and the truck past me at 10:22AM I know the exact time cause I had to take a photo of them since I knew them too well. At home I checked the tracking and saw that it has been signed and accepted at 10:30AM. NO ONE IN MY HOUSE SIGNED IT and it was a stranger's name!!!! This was absolutely ridiculous!!!! My laptop was repaired hence no password and my data was in there. This was so stressful I had to call Dell because I didn't even want to deal with those other people. It took multiple calls for Dell to call Purolator and had them pick it up from the wrong house. They delivered to a house 3 minutes away from mine yet they couldn't drop it off at my house that same day when they made a mistake since the beginning.

This gear is essential for my job, and I've booked clients knowing that I'll have this specific gear available for the job.Let me list the problems- 2 Packages shipped Saturday, Brampton to Kelowna, Delivery on Monday- Monday comes, no package. I'm told they don't have weekend shipping to Kelowna, even though I had the shipper pay $60 extra for that option in store.- Tuesday, only one package arrives. I call Purolator, they say it was never sent, even though I have a tracking number. Put me in touch with a tracing specialist who couldn't care less. Tells me he 'doesn't know what to tell me'. Eventually he confirms it was supposed to ship, but had a different tracking number. But, he doesn't know where the package is.- Thursday, they have a potential match on the package, they'll call me again on Friday to confirm.- Friday. No call.- Saturday, I call, they say it's shipping to me, will arrive Monday or Tuesday- Monday, tracking hasn't changed. It still sits in a warehouse in Toronto. I contact a rep who says, 'oh no, it'll be delivered today.'- Monday afternoon, I contact another rep who gives me 3 different answers: 1. It'll be here on Thursday, shipped via ground. 2. It's actually lost again, they had the wrong address. 3. It was supposed to be here today but wont be here until Tuesday due to a delay. This rep then refuses to answer any questions or verify which of her statements was true. I've been told I'll get a refund, but could take several weeks to make it happen. (I'm not holding my breath). If you're thinking of shipping anything of value with this company, consider stabbing your eyeballs with a dull screwdriver instead, it's more fun.Date of experience: September 18, 2017"

They should have received it the next day. 3 days later my client contacted me to tell me that they had not received the package.  I checked the tracking and it showed my package being at the Purolator depot in Edmonton.  I called Purolator and was told the highway was closed.  I spoke to my client and was told that there was construction near their building but with the exception of Purolator, all couriers were delivering to the building.  I telephoned Purolator and told them the highway was not closed but there was construction near the building.  They said they would try again.  Checked tracking the next day and it  showed my package as being at the depot in Edmonton.  I called Purolator and was told the highway was closed but they would try again.  This time the package did not even leave the depot. I called Purolator and explained about the construction and told them other couriers were delivering to the building.  They were not interested in what I had to say.  I asked for my package back.  I received the package back the next morning and sent it out by FedEx that afternoon. My client received the package the next morning. I called Purolator and told them that FedEx had delivered my package to the building.  They were not interested.  I asked that I not be charged for the nondelivery of my package.  They insisted that the highway was closed and would not remove the cost of the nondelivery from my invoice.  Today I received a bill for Purolator sending my package back to me. So they want me to pay for taking my package to Edmonton and then for bringing my package back.  Can't believe the poor service!

After going online to track the package, it says: ""Delayed in transit due to road / highway closure"".Its quite easy to check highway conditions on the weather network, and a few other sites, there are NO road closures between here at the ""sort facility"".Even if there was a road closure, which there was not, did the driver just park the car and give up? This was listed at 5am, that still leaves 11 hours to do a 4 hour drive and thus arrive during business hours.

You'd be better off with a pigeon.This is just one of my experience ( and my last ) with purolator.  I signed up for Amazon Prime and ordered a coffee press. I got a notice it would be delivered on Tuesday .... i stayed home all Tuesday and nothing. i then got a notice emailed saying they attempted delivery but were unsuccessful and would try again the following day. The following day nothing and then a phone call from a depot downtown saying they had my parcel  to come pick it up. I then phoned purolator and told them i didn't pay extra for Amazon prime to go and pick up my parcel on my dime. They said no problem they would deliver the following day. I told them to tell the driver to just honk and i would come out. ( there is a gate on my property ) The next day at 1:00 in the afternoon i hear a honk , i run out side and its Fed ex with my coffee tables i ordered from a furniture store. I wait and wait till 530 and call Purolator and they assure me the item is on the way and will be delivered by 6 pm. It never came. I phone them in the morning and they said "" the driver attempted delivery at 12:30 ""  THIS IS TOTAL B.S. !!!! No one was here at 1230. The driver is totally full of it and never picked my package up from the depot at all. Anyway at that point i told them to return to sender i will not drive all the way to their depot to pick up my parcel. I will talk to Amazon and try and have purolator removed from any delivery to this house....if they can't i will cancel my prime. Absolutely useless service if they can't get a parcel to your door.

3949,Sonny Businos,"Think Twice - Horrible ServiceI had a parcel that should have been delivered a month ago and ended up being sent back to the seller.One thing i noticed with the delivery personnel, most of the time they do not buzz. I live in an apartment in a building and one time, I noticed the Purolator personnel just keep on putting Delivery Notices on the door. My experience was the delivery guy just left a delivery notice on my door, and when I complained to customer service, they told me they never knock on the door and buzz only from the main lobby. Then how come he didnt buzz on my apt (considering there was an instruction saying buzz in to my buzz number). I was pretty sure he was able to buzz only to one apt then started leaving notices to the other doors. If these stupid people should only buzz to every apt. they have to come back to the lobby and keep on buzzing to every apt with delivery.I missed my parcel 2 consecutive week. On the third week, costumer care told me I have reached the maximum number of attempts but they will reconsider delivering it on the third week. Same thing happened!!!! I was home all day for the parcel and all I recieved was another notice. I called them again.... and they insisted to pick them up from the site. I live very far from the pick up site so, it wont happen and the fact that we availed for delivery, means we want the items delivered for convenience. We paid for it. Now, customer care told me they will deliver again next week (the reason i kept on asking them on a same day every week, is thats the only time i work from home)... forth week came, i waited all day and no parcel. I called and they said they already sent it back to the seller. Very frustrating...Also, customer care is not really helpful at all. They give wrong information and the last call i had, they gave a wrong issue number, but was able to retrieve my case using the tracking number. The second customer care i talked to was very unfriendly, she assume to much that im not working so i can just pick up the parcel from the site. These people dont own up to their mistakes.

They keep it at the sorting facility only to have you come all the way out on the outskirts of the city. This has happened 3-4 times now throughout the years. Also had a member of the neighbourhood looking around for his package that was marked as delivered only to receive a notice stating he had to pick it up.If Purolator knows you will be away at a certain date, they are almost certainly going to ""try"" to deliver in that time frame so they don't have to bother delivering it to you.

Canada Post, UPS, Fedex and DHL all have their issues, but none are as incompetent and useless as Purolator.  I read that the staff are paid less than their competitors, which might account for the dismal quality of service.The three times I've been forced to use Purolator in the last two years have all been the exact same:  overnight delivery is paid for, the item's tracking noticed is updated to ""out for delivery"" and... it never shows up.  One time I spent the whole day waiting by the window for the truck (I learned my lesson after the first time) and late in the afternoon the tracking was updated to ""address correction needed"".  I called into the call centre and confirmed that the address was always correct (it was), so the driver either A) couldn't find our place (we live in a busy city and our address is very straightforward) or B) just couldn't be bothered.  No hang-tag or sticker.  So I call into their call centre and get a litany of excuses and ""we'll page the driver and ask him to go back."" ALL THREE TIMES.  Does the driver go back?  Never.  And this goes on for DAYS.The real problem this time is that this third (and final!) time, the item being delivered is urgently needed for a health issue.  So, very, very important.  I even contacted Purolator preemptively about my issues with them in the past.  I was treated rudely and told that I just needed to wait and it would arrive.  Bet you can't guess what happened?  Yep, same thing.  Webchats and calls to managers get disconnected because they can't be bothered.You'd have better luck tying your package to a carrier pigeon than using Purolator.

Now, I'm schizophrenic with a rare form of the condition, your screwing with my medication and now I get to lose mental stability because you losers can't do anything right.

3975,Justine,"Awful Customer ServiceI work for a huge company that exclusively does business with Purolator. I was awaiting a very important package last week and received a notification on Wednesday that it would be delivered on Thursday. On Friday afternoon I called to inquire about the whereabouts of my package. I was placed on hold for a collective 3 hours, spoke to at least 5 different customer service representatives and after the first 40 minute wait on hold was transferred to a different department where I was promptly hung up on. After all of this I was told my package (only 5 boxes) was considered freight and therefore an appointment would need to be set up for delivery. I was told that no phone number was listed, however no attempt was made by Purolator to contact my company and set up a delivery. Another representative claimed that because it was freight it could only be delivered to a business, not an individual.  I was then told my package would arrive no sooner than Tuesday. The last representative I spoke to, John Touchey, flat out told me my package was NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH to go above and beyond attempting to deliver it sooner. I even offered to go to the freight centre myself to retrieve my package and was denied. I don't understand why anyone would pay to use an express delivery service only to have their package held for a week. I am disgusted by the treatment I received from Purolator and strongly encourage anyone who is thinking of using them to try UPS or FedEx instead. I have never had a more frustrating customer service experience and to have my concerns met with rude responses and zero solutions was the icing on the cake.Date of experience: August 08, 2017"
3976,Emily ,"Heads up to any business thinking of …Heads up to any business thinking of using Purolator for deliveries: I strongly suspect that Purolator drivers DO NOT make any real attempt to actually deliver your product to your customer! For the second time in two weeks, we have waited all day for our products to be shipped from Purolator, tracking it regularly and keeping an eye out on the street, only to never end up receiving it. No missed delivery notification on the door and no notice from Purolator. When we check the tracking site it will claim ""Address correction required - receiver not found."" Our building number is clearly displayed, we are on a main street in downtown Toronto, we have massive signage, and our front door is wide open. How much easier can we make it for the driver to find us? Stand outside with a neon flashing light and dance around?! We called Purolator and they claim that the issue was the delivery was addressed to an individual and not the business -- okay, fine, but how does that negate the fact that the address is the same and zero effort was made by the driver to even check if the delivery was correct? The first time this happened we gave in and picked up our order from the Purolator depot but this is a major inconvenience for us and we don't believe we should go to the effort and expense of retrieving a package that we have paid to have delivered to us! The worst part of this is that we saw a Purolator truck pull up across the street at around noon time, no driver exited the vehicle, and then 5 minutes later our tracking status was changed to ""Address correction required - receiver not found."" This suspiciously seems like the driver simply decided to not exit the vehicle, pick up our package from the back of the truck, and walk it 10 steps across the street. Lastly, I think it is important to point out that today, the same day Purolator failed to ""find our address"", FedEx, Canada Post, and an Uber driver all successfully delivered packages to us. Purolator has one job, ONE JOB! And they can't even do that.Date of experience: August 04, 2017"

I try using the website and it happens to be one of the worst, most unfriendly, confusing user interfaces i have ever come across. Does Purolator want business or do they want detractors. I would never ever set up a pick up from this courier.

Unfortunately I was out for a coffee for 15 minutes (just bad timing).Apparently, that’s it, no more attempts to deliver, no message left on the door.We received a message 2 days later on Thursday afternoon sometime that the package was available for pick up in Barrie. That would be 2 hours round trip to pick up a courier package which they've been paid to deliver.I started calling Friday morning around 9:00am. I called 4 times listened to their music for several minutes then the music stopped and nothing but dead air. I waited about 5 minutes each time to see if someone came on, not knowing if I was cut off, no one did. Finally I decided to wait after the dead air on my fifth time…30 minutes…nothing.Called again, it’s now 10:46am. This time pretending to want to schedule a pick up (just so I might talk to a human being which I don't think they have there). Same deal, a few minutes of music then nothing.Great service.

3979,Kassandra,"The 'See ya later' Purloator, terribleI have had nothing but problems with Purolator. I have actually decided to stop purchasing from a company that I make monthly purchases from because I dread having to deal with them. They have caused me to wait on a package days after I should have received it. First off, if the delivery door tag says I will have to wait until the next day to pick up my item... when I go to pick it up, the next day, it better damn well be there, not on a delivery truck that's trying to deliver it while I am at the location it was suppose to be available for pick up. That made me have to wait yet another day!This time I called them to ask if there was time if they could reattempt delivery for the same day. If not i asked that they please leave it alone at the location the label read so that I dint have the above situation happen again. What happens? I get a call telling me my package is available many miles away form me as opposed to the location discussed and marked on the delivery sticker.  They cant follow the simplest of instructions, don't give a call back when promised, terrible customer service and I hate having to deal with them as no one is ever accountable. If I needed my package by a certain day, its infuriating to have to deal with this company that doesn't have it together,.Date of experience: August 03, 2017"

Purolator seems to make a simple delivery such a stressful event for everyone involved. I have a package from dell. What should have been a fairly straightforward delivery is now a 1 week long ordeal of calls and emails.  They missed me the first time since I was at work, fair enough. I can't pick up the package since the notice said I have to go to another city! I requested a redelivery attempt and took the day off. I made sure to look out the window occasionally and even go out to check several times. 4 pm rolls around and nothing. I went out for the last time and there it was, another pick up notice. Apparently the driver didn't even bother to knock or ring the doorbell. Had the driver did that It would have taken me probably 5 seconds to go from my room to the door. Waste of time. Don't use them.UPDATE:After one of Purolator's reps contacted me and offered assistance, my package arrived shortly a few days later after the holidays. I only wish that I didn't have to go through all these channels only for a straightforward delivery like this. Nevertheless, I'm satisfied with the prompt service from Purolator's reps and so I'm changing my score to 3 stars. Purolator! Communicate with your customers, it's very important!

Same as so many other reviewers, I am waiting for a package since yesterday with the ""Attempted Delivery"" excuse. Home all day, no knock at the door. I have sent Purolator a complaint by email today. I plan on sending a complaint to Amazon as well. They should be aware of the problems that Purolator causes for their clients. There are never or rarely issues with Canada Post or any other courrier service. I hope it's only a matter of time before Amazon and others come to their senses and stop using this horrible, distrustful company. A quick Google search will show the same complaints again and again.

3985,Davis MacLean,"Never attempt over night or express deliveryI have had taken the risk of over night shipping on three occasions. Each time the order was picked up on a Thursday and delayed for some reason until, at the minimum, the following Monday. The first time it was delayed due to weather (forecast that entire week was beautiful in both provinces). I made the mistake of calling to inquire about this; put on hold for 45 minutes, talked to like I was a moron, and absolutely nothing could be done in terms of a refund. I attempted again (my stupidity) as the only packages I order are medicine I can only get through mail as I am cancer survivor. This time the package was ordered on a Wednesday and was indicated that on late Thursday night there was a delay in transit and the estimated time was not until Monday - this leaves all of Friday and Saturday to make the delivery yet an attempt, seemingly, will not be made.

So now I make Purolator attempt multiple deliveries before letting them know I wont be home during that time. Feel like I have to inconvenience them somehow for inconveniencing me.

3988,Julia,"Not doing their job - ZERO starsNEVER schedule a second attempt delivery! If you didn't get your package the first time - accept your destiny and go to the warehouse to pick it up yourself - you'll save so much time!I had 2 boxes to be delivered. The boxes are big and heavy (2 bicycles), so naturally I want them shipped to me, and not carry them, especially because I don't drive. After all, that's what delivery services are for! First, they got split, and one of them was delivered on Thursday, which is fine. The second one came on Friday at 9:20 am, but no one was home, so we got a notice of delivery, which is also fine. We got home on Friday at 7 pm, saw the notice and called them to schedule a second attempt. The person said you can schedule it for any day next week Mon to Fri, they can't give the exact time, but most likely it would be around the same time as the first attempt. So we scheduled for Monday. I took time off work and stayed at home. At 9:20 I called customer service to check when it's coming and was told that 7 pm was too late for them to process the request, so it got moved to Tuesday. Why didn't the person on the phone at 7 pm tell me that it's too late and advise me to schedule it for Tuesday?? I couldn't take time off work again, so on Monday morning I redirected the box to be delivered to my place of work. After taking down the address the person on the phone said ""Oh I just deleted it, could you tell me the address again"". I did, but it made my suspicious. That person also asked if I want both items redirected. I said there should only be 1 item at this point, but if you see that there's two, then of course, I want both of them, maybe there's some additional one that I didn't know about. I called around lunchtime again to make sure the address is fine and asked the person what address they have on file and was shocked when they read my home address!! The person apologized and said the employee I talked to in the morning just put a note with the new address, but didn't change the actual address. They changed it, I also asked about the 2 times, and they said ""I see that one has already been delivered"", and I confirmed it. So there was never a 3rd one that I didn't know about, the person on the previous call just confused me. The next day, Tuesday, I check online, and it still says Available for Pick-up. I call again, and I'm told that they are still processing the request to change the address!! I understand that the address wasn't changed Monday morning because that employee screwed up, but does it really take more than half a day to print a new label after I called again at lunchtime and they took down the address properly? Ok, now they tell me it's scheduled for Wed. On Wed morning I check online, and it's still Available for Pick up! Furious, I call and ask why it's still not on truck for delivery. Yet another person apologizes to me for a hundredth time and explains that they are looking for the second item! They cannot ship it without the other item that they can't find! How does the company not know that they already delivered the item? Even I could see it every time I tracked it online - one item has the status Delivered, the other one - Available for Pick up. The confusion about the 2nd item must have originated with the employee that screwed up the address and asked about the second item, BUT that was cleared up later when I asked again and confirmed that the 1st box was sitting in my living room. So I confirm it again, and the person makes a note that there's only 1 item to be delivered, duh. The person says it should be delivered to my place of work tomorrow, on Thursday. At this point I ask them about a note on my delivery notice saying that they'll hold the item for 5 business days at the warehouse. So I ask if they still count these past few days. And YES - I'm told that tomorrow is the last day, and it gets shipped back after that!! I tried to ask what time it would be shipped back, but the person just kept saying, it is scheduled for delivery for tomorrow, or you can pick it up at the warehouse. By then I had been told that ""it is scheduled for delivery for tomorrow"" several times, and they never followed through, so I have zero faith in the company's promises whatsoever, so I take time off work again, ask a coworker who drives to give me a ride to the warehouse and pick it up myself as soon as I can before it gets shipped back. He drove me there, and he dropped the box off at my place before heading back to work. So he did a much better job at delivery than Purolator did, even though Purolator gets paid for it. I owe him a dinner now on top of what was paid to Purolator for their ""delivery"" services. The whole thing just caused me a lot of stress about an expensive item almost being shipped back because of rescheduling over and over again, even though it was Purolator's fault every time it got rescheduled.Date of experience: July 26, 2017"

Calling the company is a worthless experience let alone placing a complaint, if Purolator was a free a service I wouldn't want to save 5$ or 10$ for shipping while receiving mistreated or damaged expensive items, Purolator should switch to picking up recycling and trash business with their current service quality and conduct, they won't get as much bad reviews all over the net nor a mountain of complaints.My solution was to call every merchant I intend to buy from right before placing the order and arrange Not sending via Purolator or at least if nothing else works insist on having Signature as per delivery.Date of experience: July 24, 2017"

4001,Amanda,"Frustrated Amazon Prime CustomerIn what seems to be a trend, I'm an Amazon Prime client who has had an order mucked up by Purolator. I was expecting a package today only to come home to a 'we missed you' notice. I live in an apartment with concierge that collects all packages. To get in to the building/to my door, any delivery person has to go through them. For some inexplicable reason, the Purolator delivery person passed them and left a note on my door saying they missed me and that I have to come pick up my package clear across town in 5 days or my package would be let go. First of all, excuse me? What kind of service is this? It's one thing if Purolator and I had an agreement that I would be home and this would be the penalty, but making demands of me when they're the third party here? Rude and ridiculous. Never mind that regular working hours conflict with delivery hours and it's more likely no one is home. Never mind that the place they've told me to pick up from is quite far and I don't drive. The whole point of delivery is that you don't pick up! I had an agreement with Amazon, no mention of having to be home (which I've never ever had to do for another Amazon carrier, even when having a bed delivered!) why should I be expected to find my way to their office? I still don't understand why they passed the concierge or didn't leave it by my door. It's not a signature required delivery. Now, at this point, I checked in with Amazon, who says delivery will be re-attempted next business day. Given the note Purolator left me, I didn't trust this. What a good thing I didn't. I gave their customer service a call where I was informed that no, they had no plans to attempt delivery again. I would like to point out that every other delivery service does this. I explained what happened and she said the best she could do is arrange for another attempt on Tuesday because they've got some cut off system for requesting the next business day. It's strange that their office is open on a Saturday but they don't deliver and Friday is too late request for Monday. I stressed that the concierge will need to take the package, because as someone with regular work hours, being home for delivery is impossible and I'm sure Purolator knows this. She promised me they would but given the experience so far and others' reviews I'm very concerned about whether I'll receive my package and what shape it'll be in (it's electronics) and I don't understand why I can't at least get it Monday. It's not my fault this happened. I would've given 1 star but the customer service rep was pleasant and competent. I like to be fair and she did what she could to help me, so that star is hers alone. She has been the only positive representation of this company so far. I will be contacting Amazon to lodge a complaint. Imagine if I had relied on expecting another attempt based on what Amazon told me. All that money spent would be gone. I am not confident I will receive my package this Tuesday given everything that has happened. I am expecting to get another 'we missed you' notice and for the concierge to tell me they didn't speak to them. We'll see. If I get it, I will be inspecting it thoroughly for damage. I would really like to receive it tomorrow or Monday. Delivery problems is not what I pay Amazon Prime for.Date of experience: July 15, 2017"

As it's 130 pounds we were told that Purolator would call us to arrange a delivery time. On Monday we came home to a delivery notice on our door instructing us to pick this up. I'm 7 months pregnant, and we have a car that I doubt this would fit in, even if I could help lift it. I've contacted Purolator a few times to get this re-delivered only to be told that they're ""working on it"" and that they need 2 drivers to make the delivery (I understand this as it is a heavy item). I'm worried my order will be sent back due to Purolator's incompetence. Had they phoned on Monday to arrange a delivery time we wouldn't have this problem at all! The fact that they've been unable to organize 2 drivers to deliver this since Monday has me doubting that the package was even on the truck Monday.Date of experience: July 13, 2017"

Amazon Prime Day was yesterday, so I bought a lot of stuff which got delivered today. It's been raining every day for the past month and I live on a busy street, yet the driver thought my front door was a safe location to stack a pile of boxes about the height of a 6 y/o kid. Here's what it looked like : imgur .com/a/JEzzl. I swear the VIZIO logo could easily be seen from the street. I'm lucky nothing had been stolen (that I know of), but now everyone knows I own a bunch of new stuff, which doesn't male me feel safe one bit. I'm expecting more boxes but I won't be home for a few days, so chances are the next batch is gonna stand there for a while, and I know for a fact that my drivers never bother reading the notes I leave for them on my door. Anyway, wish I could give Purolator a big zero and, sadly, I'm still stuck with them because of Amazon and some others... :(Date of experience: July 13, 2017"

They assured me the guaranteed 9am delivery option would not let me down so I happily paid $65 and went on with my day.  To make a long story short,  phone calls began around 10am, 2 hours of back and forth the envelope arrived at 1:00 and the driver said if we didn't call it would have been end of day because for whatever the reason the sticker fell off.Needless to say the flight was missed and we learnt a great lesson.  Understanding that things happen and not really upset at this point I phoned Purolator to inquire about a refund, figuring that it was common sense with delivery at 1 and payment for 9am I thought it was a no brainer.The call began with attitude before they even had the invoice number or any information, I was told that nothing is guaranteed...even the expensive guaranteed service I was sold.  After review still with attitude I was provided a $30 credit which is something but still didn't seem right, the way I was handled seemed like it was my fault and I did something wrong and only received a partial credit because it was still delivered.I suppose BUT...terrible attitude, service and resolve...I will not be looking for Purolator when I need to ship something and if asked would not recommend.Date of experience: July 12, 2017"

I was awake at 9 am and tracked my order at around 10. It said that they had attempted delivery even though i was awake and received no buzzer or knock on my door. I called their customer service and she said that i dont have a buzzer code on my address. After i insisted and told her to read my address back to me, it was clear that the address was correct and the buzzer code was indeed on it. My item is now at their depot around 20km away from my house. This service is awful and i hope i never have to deal with them again. I've ordered with amazon before and all the companies i've dealt with have buzzed me and brought the item up to me .EDIT: I was contacted by customer service and they told me that my item would be shipped to the closest depot. It is 6:42 at the moment and i still have no information about my item and they close at 8. This is literally the worst service ever. Please do not do business with Purolator, there are a million other options that know how to provide good service.

Twice in a row now (for the same reward) I've had notifications that the package was returned as undeliverable despite receiving absolutely nothing from the company - no call, no knock at my apartment door, no package slip left at my mailbox. Literally every other company is able to deliver to a downtown Toronto apartment building with no trouble - UPS, FedEx, Canada Post, all great. But with this order, all I get from Purolator is a message from my credit card company telling me it was returned as undeliverable. They don't even bother to drop it at a local post office.

While I was cooking my son told me they r here and I also saw a purolator truck was parking in front of my house. My son asked me to recieve that and I said let them bring the product out and they will knock the door. But after 2 mins my son came back and say there is no truck there , did you recieve the delivery. I said no one knock the door or ring the bell. Then he went out side and check the mail box . They left a paper saying that they missed us.  Now I have to drive 25 mins at least to pick that up with my baby. Now what is the point to order online and pay to deliver at home, if I have to go to pick it up from even a far place than my nearest Best Buy store. No one could say that I was not at home that time because I am not working right now and staying with my baby whole time. This is not the first time . I could believe them if I didn't see the truck and they didn't even try to deliver it. We paid to get delivery at home , not to deliver that paper. Those drivers are getting money not to deliver that paper only , I think.

4013,L. Collins,"I Just filed a THIRD complaint with …I Just filed a THIRD complaint with amazon.ca regarding Purolator My experience has been: Purolator doesn't ""deliver."" Purolator is a special snowflake of a company that expects YOU to go to THEIR depot to pick up your items. 1. I live quite far away from the nearest Purolator depot -  and I don't drive. When I order items online, I expect them to be delivered to my home. Purolator DEFEATS the whole purpose of ordering online.2. These Purolator ""depots"" keep extremely inconvenient hours for most working people, and only hold your items for five days before returning them back to the sender. Work 9 - 5? Good luck getting your stuff, in most cases...3. Purolator doesn't ""do"" apartments. They won't buzz your unit number, and most times they won't even leave a notice to let you know they've been around.4. Purolator drivers will lie and say that the delivery was ""refused"" - or that nobody was at home to accept delivery. The internet is loaded with complaints from people who waited at home all day long to receive a package. No calls, no doorbells, no notices. They check the Purolator tracker only to find that their parcel is back at the depot.5. If amazon continues to use this courier, I will have to stop ordering from them. This is absolutely ridiculous. Somehow Canada Post and UPS manage to deliver my parcels. Purolator is 0/3 at this point. Google the complaints about this company, people. And Beware.Date of experience: July 11, 2017"

4020,James Penner ,"God help you if you use this for …God help you if you use this for anything business related. I've only ever shipped two things through Purolator (not by choice of course). This time is the final straw. I lost out on a $500 side job this weekend because the Purolator driver is too lazy to even come down my street! I live in a rural area about 45 seconds outside my cities perimeter and I have security cameras in both my driveways that can see the whole street. No ONE Purolator truck came down my street. I figured okay maybe they ran late because we had a pretty bad storm that day - they'll deliver it tomorrow for sure right? NOPE! Same line about not being able to find my address (even though its wood burnt into a 4 foot by 1 foot wood block tied to my chain link fence less than 5 feet from the street). If you're not intelligent enough to see this, you shouldn't be driving a truck or anything for that matter. It completely astonishes me how companies like Amazon and Newegg still ship through Purolator. At this point the service is so poor that I'm convince Purolator is discounting their bulk rates for these two companies so deeply that Purolator is paying Amazon to ship packages for them. There's simply no other logical reason to ever have a contract with a company known for such cringe worth customer service. Everywhere you look are one start reviews. Did I also mention I've had 100+ shipments delivered to this address last year by Canadapost/DHL/FedEx/UPS. Even Loomis is capable of finding my house (first try - super impressed) and delivering full skids right into my garage. This is why its so confusing to me why a Purolator driver managed to not once, but twice manage to ""miss"" my house. What a joke. If you rely on shipments of product to make money, stay as far away from this disaster of a company as you possibly can. I'd rather ship with untracked Canada post mail than this garbage.Date of experience: July 03, 2017"

However, the branch clerk was awful, rude and condescending. I've never gone out of my way to submit a complaint online about a service. I'm usually cooperative and patient. However, the Purolator in Ottawa (Hawthorne Location) is completely out of line. - I live in centre town and enjoy benefiting from amazon deliveries to my door as I don't own a car. I have no issues with any courier service with the exception of Purolator.  - I work business hours.- Purolator only delivers during business hours. - They try 1 delivery a day for 3 days...my package is now 3 days late minimum.- I was informed that the release waiver I signed is void since I live in a house with more than 1 unit... defeats the point of the waiver. Whether or not the package is left at the door is to the driver's discretion... that's just odd. Why rely on legally binding waiver when you can rely on the subjectivity of human being?   - If the driver opts out of leaving it at the door, they return it by default to the furthest location from the downtown core possible - 30 minutes drive away! It's like they're dismissing their customers intentionally... I haven't even addressed the branch worker's condescending tone when parroting this illogical policy.  It is the most absurd delivery protocol I've encountered yet. Considering our increasing reliance on online shopping and the importance drawn to efficiency and access, I would urge them to review their policy.Date of experience: June 28, 2017"

4051,Gustaf,"Positively incompetentPositively incompetent. Delivered a package at an odd hour; left a notice that had a 'tracking' number nobody at Purolator could make sense of and the name of the recipient was a random word rather than any name of anyone in the household. Apparently they don't check to make sure their drivers have basic literacy skills. Judging by what I'm reading here their hallmark is badness, pure and simple. Avoid them!Date of experience: May 16, 2017"
4052,Dmitry Solomadin,"The worstThe worst. Avoid at all costs. Ordered 4 or 5 items on Amazon, everything was delivered within 2-3 days, even king sized bed was delivered within 4 days and perfectly on time. But the item that was supposed to be delivered by Purolator was not delivered within a week! And they did not contact me, did not gave me any estimate worst. When I reached out to customer support they said that because it is a heavy item (55lb are you kidding me?) they need 2 additional days to arrange a truck. I can't believe companies like that are still on the market.Date of experience: May 13, 2017"
4053,Customer,"No wordsIn my four or five interactions with Purolator over two shipments (one in October and one in May), I have not once had a positive or productive experience. On both occasions, their 'attempt at delivery' was nothing shy of pathetic; just because there is a buzzer where you have to search a name or unit number, doesn't mean 'no buzz code, address correction required'. Both times I was not left a delivery slip notifying me of an 'attempted delivery'. I had to first notice my packages hadn't arrived by their expected date and use my tracking number to determine that because of other peoples' incompetencies I now have to go out of my way to pick up a package that was paid to have delivered to its recipient. I have never had this issue with any other courier company; everything has either been properly delivered via the buzzer or automatically taken to the nearest pickup location with a delivery notice left neatly at the mailbox or door. I wish I had a job where I could not give a **** and just walk up to a door and say, ""well, looks like they're not home, back to the warehouse it goes. They'll figure it out at some point, my pen is too far in my pocket for me to reach in and write these people a note that I came by."" The customer service and call centre staff for Purolator are just as much an atrocity as their delivery staff; being told a package is at one location for pickup after several painful phone calls and then arriving at that pick up location only to find out it has really been taken to a facility ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY. Buddy, just because your computer reads it is in 'Toronto', doesn't mean you should just go off naming a random Toronto Purolator location. Check your **** before you tell your customer to go pick their things up. I have never been so dissatisfied with a company that I went off on a rampage to write a review for them. After my first experience with Purolator I thought, it was close to Thanksgiving, people make mistakes, give them a break etc etc and kept my delivery experience to myself. But after today, and after reading so so SO many negative reviews of this company online, I am so glad to know I am not the only one who has felt this way. There are literally hundreds of one and two star reviews for this company all sharing some variation of poor customer service and delivery speed, and its not just a few hundred bad ones out of thousands of reviews. It's literally JUST hundreds of bad reviews. I hope they get incorporated into a company that actually knows what they are doing. Once I get my package on Monday I am doing everything in my power to not support Purolator courier services.Date of experience: May 12, 2017"

This week we shipped to Stouffville from Toronto of 7 items packed with 1/2"" bubble wrap and fragile outside the box still 5 items damaged (broken). These items cost us thousands excluding  shipping cost...How they handle our shipments? These items cannot be broken easily.

There was no knocking at the door, no buzzing, nothing. Upon refreshing the online tracking, it gave me a delivery failure again, and you guessed it, the driver left no notice again, nothing whatsoever. I called purolator again trying to explain the situation, but the connector was rude and didn't even let me finish my sentence.

They didn't do that, instead they returned back the package to Toronto ( I'm in Montreal ) . Called them again and they apologize like 10 times and order to send the package back to Montreal. I tell them two or three times that send the package to their office in downtown, and on the phone they confirmed my request. They didn't do that again, they sent it wherever they wanted to.  The day of pickup the item finally arrive, and I confirmed on the purolator page and by phone that the item was in their downtown office and they confirmed it.I went to pickup it to downtown, and it wasn't there. The woman clerk was not  respectful and even yelled at me. Phone customer service is worst, is like they hire old angry people. And if you are a french speaker, don't even try it.

4081,Kuma Tenshi,"Don't ever use them if you can avoid doing so!!!I had a package sent through Purolator, from British Columbia to London Ontario, through Purolator Express. Basically guaranteed to be at the destination and delivered by end of next business day. Not exactly a cheap method of shipping, but it was an important item that was needed. It made it across the country fine enough, and was out for delivery at 9 am on March 6th. I've had issues with Purolator in the past getting into the building, even though literally every other courier has zero problem doing it. So whenever I find myself in a situation where I had no control over who something was sent through, I tend to just keep an eye out all day, as I work from home anyways. Business days tend to end at 6pm, as do their deliveries and the like. I had seen no sight of them all day, and around 5:20 I decided that perhaps the driver was simply running late, or my area was at the tail end of their route for the day. It was annoying, but at least I'd ensure I was at the lobby door to let them in regardless. I had waited at various points down there throughout the day already as well anyways. 6 pm ends up coming around, and nothing, no sight of any truck on the streets, nor in the parking lot right in front of the building, both of which I had full view of the entire time. So I went back up to my apartment with a sick feeling in my gut, to discover that sure enough, the tracking now claimed an attempt was made at 5:50 pm and it claimed I was ""inaccessible"". Which was a load of crap!!I immediately contacted them through Live Chat on their website, and big surprise, the first rep I was greeted with actually defended the driver and refused to file a complaint for me, instead adamant I just get a re-delivery for tomorrow. Kept asking me if there was a buzzer code, and even told me ""the driver won't even get out of the truck for apartments if there is no buzzer code listed with the address."" I kid you not. After pointing out that A) there is a list of all residents and their accompanying buzzers right inside the door B) no god damn apartment in the WORLD doesn't have something like and C) I have HAD deliveries done by Puro and others no problem, using the buzzer system!! (Yes, amazingly, there are Puro drivers out there with a head attached to their shoulders, but they are quite rare). She was rather flummoxed by my pointing out logic and reality to her. After telling her off, I just contacted another rep. They did file a complaint for me to the depot, however, they seemed disinclined to believe my claim much like the first rep. So in the end, I just had them send it to a Puro agent at a retail printing store, and then spent 35 dollars on a taxi to pick the damned thing up. I have no car as I work from home and my brother can otherwise drive me on the rare occassion I need to go out, and I am also not in good enough shape to use public transit unfortunately. HENCE why it is important for items to be delivered to my freaking door!! Something Purolator seems disinterested in general on doing, despite it being the core and main point of their entire business.

Instead she offered me to lodge a complaint against the driver, which I thought was weird. She said drivers are supposed to leave stickers specifying details. So I asked if they have a designated driver for a particular location or more than one driver and she didn't even know that!! What an absurd way to pass the buck and just blame the driver. I just hope Amazon doesn't use their carrier services. They just screw up amazon prime, big time.Date of experience: March 21, 2017"
4092,V Lashing,"the worst. If anyone can delay things it purolatorWorst company hands down. Delivered my stuff to wrong address, 3 blocks down the street more than once. Never ring the bell just plop it down and off they go. If the box is heavy its not getting plopped at the door either, its going to be in the driveway at roadside.Thats if they get it right at all. I actually had an argument with them once because a 2 part shipment was a light box and a heavy box. The light one arrived. When I called in the woman said the heavy box was there in her office and not to worry, its Friday see and no one wanted to lift heavy on Friday. Someone will come Monday. No lie, that happened. Another time the box came wet and smelling like pee. Called in and they said they had a chemical spill on the truck ... OK so you just deliver wet with chemical? Then they backtracked and said there was an animal shipment .. so it was pee? Then they backtracked again. At least they named it right puroLATERDate of experience: March 20, 2017"

4095,IMEN TRAD,"Worst shipping company ever! Very bad experience!I waited all day at home on Monday for a delivery and nobody came and when I checked the package tracking online it said that there was an attempted delivery and that my address was incomplete, which wasn't. When I called, the customer service agent was very rude and told me that they don't access apartment buildings if the receiver is not at home. I told him that I waited all day for my delivery and that nobody showed up and even if the delivery man couldn't access my building, they could have done what every shipping company does and leave a card with the instructions to get my package (By the way, I previously received a package delivered by Purolator and they left a card doswnstairs in my building, so this is not new for them). When I told him that, the agent was even ruder and told me that this is their policy and that they don't access apartments buildings...Obviously lying... He aggressively offered to put my package on hold at a local Purolator store which I accepted thinking that it will be easier to finally get my products but, today it's Thursday and still no call from them...

Canada Post, DHL and UPS have never had any requirements.  How is the customer supposed to know?There is an intercom at the front door with 11 names on it.  All that was required was to find our name and press the button.  Or call us at the phone number on the order.Apparently the customer can waste a whole day but the driver doesn't tell inclined to even try!Worst service ever.

My apartment has a big sign on the very first door that says ""Please input apartment number for buzzer"". Canada Post, DHL, and UPS have had no problems ever in the past understanding the sign and I've always received shipments from them. I asked over the phone to attempt another delivery the next day. I was told this was no longer possible (despite their website saying to call up and schedule a delivery).I have no choice who ships my parcels from Amazon. From the times that I have had my parcels shipped through Purolator, I have never (I really mean never) received my package without a hassle. The driver's don't seem to care.

A contact attempt has been placed to attempt to ""permanently provide approval"" for drop off at my flat, if this is possible then I wont consider Purolator any more insidious than the other big courier companies.

4105,Brian Morrison,"As a delivery company a total disasterOn Thursday the tracking website indicated that my parcel was on the truck and would be delivered by 8pm on Thurs . I contacted the hotline to request a more accurate delivery time . Unable was the reply ,. Well can you tell me the location of the truck so that I can get an approximate idea of delivery schedule . Sorry we don't know that . Well can you phone the driver and ask him . No we can't do that either . Well 8pm came and went no delivery . At 9pm the website was updated informing me that the truck had broken down early in the day and there was to be no delivery that day I had remained at home from 8am to 8pm waiting delivery . No phone call , no email , no contact of any kind informing me that delivery would not take place that day . Despite contacting the helpline twice during the day .I was then promised delivery on Friday with delivery again sometime before 8pm . Foolishly after the debacle from the previous day I expected that I would be afforded some sort of priority or even the courtesy of a more accurate delivery time . Again after contacting the help line and voicing my complaint I requested that a supervisor contact me regarding my complaint . Not unexpectedly, the call back did not materialise .8pm on Friday came and went with NO delivery . So to date I have remained at home for 2 days for absolutely nothing .This company cannot make deliveries Cannot contact their customers Cannot follow up on complaints Cannot contact their drivers Cannot track their vehicles Just what are they capable of doing ? Because they seem incapable of making a simple scheduled delivery It's now Sat, day 3 of this debacle but of course Purolator doesn't deliver on Sat or Sun so it's going to have to be Mon for delivery . Which means that I have had to spend 3 days at home waiting for a parcel delivery .Sat I phoned their customer service line spoke to a very nice lady who offered no more than a sorry and platitudes about"" how we care about our customers "" Yeah Well your actions scream the exact opposite .There has been absolutely  no attempt to rectify the situation , no special delivery no offers of compensation it's totally disgusting Someone in management really needs to shake up this  business  because all that I can see is incompetence at every level starting with their core business .I cannot suggest strongly enough that you avoid this business at all costsInteresting to note that nowhere on their website is there a facility for customers to blog about their experiences , probably for very good reason having read  the awful reviews hereDate of experience: March 04, 2017"

When it comes to apartment building and you need him to knock the door and leave the package at the front desk, believe me, he won't even bother to enter the lobby.

They have done this to me 3 times so far - either leaving packages outside my front door without notifying me or even knocking. The second time they did that the package was not there, but Purolator claimed that they left it. When I told them it wasn't there, they simply took no responsibility and essentially said they take no responsibility. Honestly what kind of delivery service leaves packages unattended? I've had UPS or Canada Post attempt to deliver my package multiple times all in an attempt to protect my package. This time around I had ordered something urgently, which I needed by a particular day as I was leaving out of town. Day one - they didn't deliver, said the address was ""undeliverable or unknown"". Okay then. Then I phoned them with instructions on how to deliver it, where to go, who to contact, gave them a back up number, and again they didn't deliver my package.

But after this experience , I am compelled to warn future clients from ordering from purolator. This review takes precedence over studying for my exams (I'm a university student) - that is how bad my experience was.Their customer service representatives are rude, incompetent and obviously hate their job. I've spoken to Cassie, Donna and someone else who has straight up interrupted/cut off my explanation more than 5 times in the conversation. My parents spent $75 on their ""next day delivery service"" but it's been more than 8 days with no sign of the package. When calling them to follow up it was a string of being transferred to different departments and after 1 hour on the phone the only solid answer I had received was (verbatim) ""for an unspecified reason the trucks were unable to deliver your package"". Literally that was their answer - that they had no clue why.The package was a care package full of food made by my family. My 80 year old grandma hand-made meatballs, buns and meat sauce for me. We trusted purolator to deliver the package the ""next day"" as per their advertised service. Not only has the food most likely have gone bad by now, purolator refuses to claim responsibility and denies even a simple apology. At several times of the conversation on the phone the representative raised her voice to me to a shouting level, which I had recorded on my friend's phone. I have every evidence of their mismanagement and poor service. I felt mentally harassed, embarrassed and belittled to the point where I was shedding tears of frustration. It's time for clients to take their money elsewhere as purolator truly is an apathetic, low-grade, incompetent and disappointing service. Never, never order from them!

I contacted the customer service department, but they said that they wouldn't be responsible for any damage if I had personally packed my stuff. Heavy duty cardboard boxes were used for half of the packages in order to give extra protection, but this horrible company wore, crashed and dented those thick boxes. I can't imagine how terribly Purolator treated the packages during the delivery.

At 2:51 p.m., the website announced, ‘Delayed in transit’ and that they will make another attempt the next day. It is important to note that I received a FedEx delivery that day; Purolator cannot site inclement weather as an excuse.On February 08, Purolator’s website said the parcel was on the delivery track and that it was on its way. At 2:39 p.m., the website declared, ‘Delayed in transit’ and that they will make another attempt the next day.

One time Purolator lost my package delivered it to the wrong address and refused to take responsibility for the package leaving me out of $200. It didn't matter who I spoke to about the incident nobody seem to care,  and I was left without my prescription and out $200.

It doesn't matter who I speak to you I feel undervalued as a customer  and unappreciated.  I have asked my provider if there is another delivery company that I could use and unfortunately the only one that they choose to use is Purolator despite my continuous calls of complaint about Purolator.  Because of Purolator I will be switching producers and it's unfortunate that I must change my means of medication and they must lose a customer based on the actions and service of a well-known and reputable company such as Purolator.

It hasn't happened yet due to the ""missed delivery"" excuse which is code for ""high volumes"" (i.e.: Purolator has taken on more business than they can handle).  It seems only logical to me that drivers should continue deliveries until the truck is empty or else put more drivers and trucks on the road.  I've wasted three days of my life awaiting delivery of my expensive Home Depot shipment because I don't want to take the chance on it being left outside my door if I'm not home.

4135,Purolator Sucks,"Laziest, most useless company out thereI paid $30 dollars for expedited shipping on an item I desperately needed. It arrived a day later than I needed it to be here and when they ""attempted delivery"" they put absolutely no effort into doing so. They claimed I didn't give the buzz code to my apartment building (which there is no such thing for the building I live in) however, it is an extremely busy building it is not hard to wait for another person to walk in and walk in with them, OR they could have used their brains and walked in through the tenant office doors like most other companies do. When I called to ask why they hadn't just called me when they ran into this issue they said they don't call clients ever because nobody has phones on route...apparently in 2017 NOBODY that works for Purolator owns a phone...The customer service representative I dealt with was extremely rude and unprofessional. I then asked if it could be delivered to my house the next day as I would be home the entire time and she refused because I still don't hadn't given the access code to my building- even though there isn't one its just entered through an electronic key. She then told me where I needed to go to pick up the parcel which was 5 kilometres from my house. Not having a car I said that was ridiculous and she said thats my only option. So I could either pay 20 dollars to Uber to this location each way, or walk two hours to get there. Since I had already paid a ridiculous amount to get it delivered I walked for two hours to pick up the parcel that should have just been delivered to my place anyways. Absolutely pathetic customer service, if there was anyway I could boycott getting anything delivered from this company again I most certainly would.Date of experience: January 18, 2017"

4138,Alyssa S,"If I could only give it 0 starsIt completely shocks me how terrible this service is. My order was shipped in the facility and I was notified that the postal code was wrong. As anyone would do I contacted customer service as I was going to fix whatever problem they had. After the longest waiting time (which I expected), they told me the address was fixed right away. The only problem was that because of the address mixup they scheduled delivery for the next week. I was annoyed because I didn't pay 30$ for express shipping only for my order to arrive a week after the day I need it for. I went on their ""live chat"" and talked to three different ladies who told me different things on the possibility of me being able to pick it up at the location instead. I was told that the request of having my order picked up is being processed but is in no way guaranteed. What's the point then? I am truly unimpressed with Purolator's ability to actually deliver and I cannot trust them with any future deliveries again.Date of experience: January 14, 2017"

It is now day three without needed medication, it stayed at the orginal facility for over 24 hours ( I have the screen shot that shows the problems from pick up to now),  customer service was nothing but rude and did not care. I was suppose to be called when my package was found as there is a high priority ticket on the shipment and received no call, I even said to the customer service rep I didn't believe I would get a call and I was right of course. All around horrible service. I will be lodging a complaint with BBB.Date of experience: January 13, 2017"
4140,Anonymous,"Choose Purolator if you want to lose business, have angry customers, or don't want things delivered.This is the first time I have ever left a review because I felt it was necessary to warn all potential customers who would ever consider Purolator.I ordered from Dell on Dec 26, 2016. Was told delivery would take place on Jan 4, 2017. Dell called and notified me delivery would take place between 8am-6pm and I had to be home to sign for it. I knew I would be away so I asked Dell to have them deliver it on Friday Jan 6, 2017. Dell told me that it was too late to change the first delivery but that they will have them redeliver on Friday.Well guess what? Purolator never delivered on Wednesday. Tracking said it was on truck but then ""delayed in transit"". Next day (Thursday) it said it was on truck for delivery. Then ""delayed due to missed transit"" by 10am!! I'm a little peeved now because I had to sit around waiting because I had to sign to receive the package and my time was being wasted as I had work to do. I went on the online chat and they told me ""due to high volumes and bad weather"" they wouldn't be able to deliver today and said it will be there tomorrow Friday Jan 7, 2017. I questioned them about the weather as all other deliveries I expected from other companies like UPS were arriving absolutely fine and ON TIME. They just gave me the high volume/bad weather excuse again and told me to check back tomorrow by 10am if it didn't arrive. So here we go; ANOTHER day waiting at home on Friday. Instead of doing my errands and things that I needed to do, I stayed home waiting and waiting. Then to my surprise or lack of, it was ""delayed in transit"" AGAIN. It now says the estimated time of delivery will be on Monday Jan 9, 2017. I decided I would wait one more day and receive it on Monday. But wait! There are more surprises! I went out Sunday morning/afternoon and came home to what? A note on my apartment door saying they tried to deliver and I wasn't there so I would now have to go pick it up at a Purolator location that was not even the closest one to me and that it would be available on Tuesday. Not Monday. Seriously. SUNDAY?!?! Who delivers on Sunday and why would they tell me on the tracking page Monday and then deliver on Sunday? I called them and asked them to redirect the package to a closer depot. However they said they weren't able to due to the city I was in. So I asked them to redeliver which they said they could and I asked them to do it on Wednesday when I could be home to wait from 8am-6pm because THEY CANNOT GUARANTEE DELIVERY TIMES. They said they'll make a note to tell the drivers to deliver in the morning if at all possible.Thinking this was all over and done with, I received another call from Dell on Tuesday Jan 10, 2017 following up with me to inform me that the package is at the depot. I told them that I had spoken to Purolator already and that they would redeliver on Wednesday so we hung up. Moment later, Dell calls again. They called Purolator just to make sure and to my disbelief, Dell told me that Purolator has no record of a re-delivery request. I was so ticked off. The Dell rep then offered to request a delivery again with Purolator. They called me back right away and said it was confirmed that it would be delivered by Wednesday Jan 11, 2017 end of day. I then asked for them to send it to another address just in case the driver was too lazy to use the buzzer that I had given them. I then decided to check the tracking page again and another surprise. They apparently tried to deliver on Monday but ""receiver unavailable"". ****!!! I was home at that time of delivery and no buzzer, no tag on door, NOTHING!Well, you guessed it! Wednesday came and went by. No delivery. ""Delayed due to missed delivery"". ONE WEEK LATER and still nothing!Estimated time of delivery: Thursday Jan 12, 2017 by end of day. I'm writing this as of Thursday Jan 12, 2017. I had already called Dell to see if there was anything they could do. They called Purolator and told me they would deliver by the end of day. I don't believe them. Dell reps are great and look after their customers but please PLEASE use a different courier. I realized that I'm not the only customer having to deal with this but seriously, customers need to stop buying from companies who use Purolator until they switch to a courier that will actually deliver as promised.I told the Dell rep to inform the company to stop using Purolator as I will not buy from them again if I ever have to deal with this courier again.It is now Thursday Jan 12, 2017 in the early afternoon and the saga continues...Date of experience: January 12, 2017"
4141,Bruce Robinson,"Terrible serviceHad a package supposed to be delivered by Jan 5th 2017. Every day after that it was delayed. On Jan 10 put trace on it, told maybe next day then maybe next day again. All this time it was sitting in the local center, just not loaded onto a truck. Finally, on Jan 12th I went and picked it up myself at the center. From ordering and me picking it up it took 18 days .....unbelievable. I could have walked back and forth  to the warehouse with the product in less time. The people we talked with were very nice and tried to help but something is wrong with their system.

It is mind blowing how such a large company can have such poorly trained staff. It is not their fault, I'm sure they are just following protocol but this has caused me to absolutely never use them again. They have no idea what they are doing...apparently it's a big deal for them to follow up on your issue, and I was essentially refused when I asked to speak to a manager? I was then told one would call me...funny, that hasn't happened?

4144,Brett Harris,"The worst company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing withThe single most worst experience I have ever had with a company. First they cannot locate my package via tracking number despite the fact THEY have sent me a tracking number! I say I've called to ask for advice as my door buzzer in my new home is not working currently, could they possibly phone me when they arrive. The answer is a blunt no: the driver does not have a phone. 21st century....delivery company...and no phone - I find that hard to believe! I work in customer service, if a patron asks me to make a phone call on their behalf by God I'll go the very small extra mile to make a short phone call for them. I ask for what I should do therefore. I basically get a lackadaisical attitude response of 'they don't do that' and lazy 'yeah's' and 'no's'. Basically exceptionally poor customer service; no solution, no advice, no help whatsoever. So after being on the phone for over 20 minutes at this point (I was on hold for over 15 minutes)I ask to speak to a manager. At this point the voice of the agent I was speaking to broke a little and it was obvious she became nervous that I was willing to take this further (her douchey attitude changed for the first time).Then I was put on hold for another ten minutes...before the phone call abruptly terminated. I guess they hung up on me. I complained to them via email (which they limit how many words you can write so you can't truly tell them the whole negative experience you have just had) and I never received a response. I then chatted with their online chat team, who also could not find my order via their tracking number), who basically gave me no help...and then surprise surprise, that conversation abruptly stopped - and I went to the back of the queue to wait to speak to a new agent. At this point in this shoddy experience you would expect someone to contact you back - but over 24 hrs later I still have not been contacted. They also expect you to sit in waiting for them to arrive for 10 hours! 10 hours (read 21st century again?). I asked are they in Richmond for 10 hours? 'No they are not' was the reply. So they must be able to gage roughly, if working on a similar route-routine, a lesser time period than 10 hours. 4 or even 5 hrs rather than 10 - that's a whole day! But it doesn't stop there. I'm tracking my package and low and behold at 5pm (its been out for delivery since 7.30am this morning) my tracking number says 'Attention: delayed due to missed delivery"". I looked this up on line and basically means they missed me because they were too busy. So they expect me to wait another 10 hrs tomorrow? Who knows! As if I call them to find out what that means and enquire when the hell my package is arriving I'll be on hold waiting for a further 20 minutes to probably speak to some inept or shoddy-attitude agent. It would have been quicker and more convenient for me to bus, train, then bus again to the Bestbuy store, buy the damn thing in person, and then travel the same route all the way home. The whole point of a delivery is for CONVENIENCE and this whole travesty has been completely the opposite. By the looks of all the other negative reviews and 1-star-or-less company ratings I'm seeing online - they obviously could not care less. I will tick the box at the bottom of this page saying 'notify Purolator of my review' but do you think I will get any response?! Hell noDate of experience: January 11, 2017"

For a courier company owned mostly by Canada Post, the service is like night and day between the two. Was told the package would arrive by Dec 30.

4152,Ken,"Not deliveredI am relieved that I am not the only one having troubles with Purolator.  I waited all day yesterday and no notice of delivery.  When I tracked the shipment online, it said no one at home to receive.  I called Purolator and asked them to redeliver but they told me the driver came and knocked on the door, noone answered.  I said he should have rang the bell because if I was upstairs, i might not hear it.  This assumes that the driver has come.  But I am not sure because Purolator said I should have a notice of delivery.  I said the driver might have gone to a wrong house.  Anyway, Purolator said they won't redeliver for items over 70 lbs.    I called best buy where I bought the desk from.  They called Purolator headquarter and arranged a delivery.  Best Buy said the Purolator will try again tomorrow.   But then the local Purolator called and said they wouldn't because it was their policy.  2 answers from Purolator( one from 800 number, one from local purolator ).  I said what will happen is that the item will be returned to best Buy and I reorder from Best Buy and we would go through this again.  Why wastes everybody's time?  I guess Purolator bets on that and charges Best buy again (bec shipping is free for me).  Purolator is in delivery business and it is very unprofessional.  ""Knock on the door? "". They need to train their employees better.    Is additional shipping fee is what they hope to get ?    Then good luck to their business.

4153,Jandb Ho,"Worst possible customer service and employee incompetencyI got into a heated argument with the phone operator because the driver did not actually do the delivery. I was home all day and didn't see so much as a single piece of notice. On redelivery, they gave a notice with squibbles drawn on it that looks nothing like letters of the alphabet or any kind of digits, Roman or otherwise. Then the phone representative demanded that I read that to her and that she can't help me if I can't read. Well, what a nice way to discriminate against the illiterate, if I was one. And of course, it really was their employee, the driver, who don't know how to write and pretends that random lines are writing.I have never had other delivery services ridicule me for not being able to read words from ineligible drawings.

When I got to the store I noticed that my package had been opened before I even got there pretty sure that's illegal . I was basically told that I need to take it up with amazon even though it is completely apparent it was damaged because of the driver leaving it outside seeing as it is still wet. A second employee came out and escalated the situation, even after I said I wanted them to finish so I could leave. She even threatened to call the police on me because I was swearing.

I am not very optimistic but take them at their word. 14th still no package. Tracking continues to say it's in sorting Depot. Call again. An investigation is opened. Morning of 15th someone calls to say they are looking into it. Whole day goes by and nothing. No package or subsequent phone call. I call back and they tell me they have no information and I can't be connected to the person handling the investigation. They don't have phone numbers for them, only email.Morning of 16th I call again. No news. Demand to speak to person doing investigation, oh yes no problem! I'll connect you right away. (Why did I not get the same story the night before?)Leave a message and get a call back fairly quickly. I am told The driver in my area is overloaded and has packages on his truck that have been waiting OVER A WEEK for delivery. No, my package won't be delivered today. In fact he has 100s of people he needs to call back and tell them the same thing. It's such a busy time of year.Finally I ask if there is a way for me to just pick up the package myself. Why yes ma'am, of course that is an option. Ummm, what? I have been calling every day all week and no one even once gave me the option of getting it myself??I cannot believe the incompetence of everyone involved. I understand this is a busy time of year, but the funny thing is... this time of year HAPPENS EVERY YEAR. How has Purolator not figured out that they need more drivers/staff around Christmas? Even if I get my cards today it's pretty much too late for them to be sent out in time. And this could have been avoided if customer service had cared at all about my problem and even tried the tiniest bit to help me.I am disgusted at the lack of concern for late shipments. How can a company care so little about its customers. They should be ashamed.It's safe to say I will NEVER use Purolator again and will actively avoid ordering from companies online who use Purolator to ship. WORST. COMPANY. EVER.Date of experience: December 16, 2016"
4179,Brian C,"Purolator never even tries to deliver to condosI hate it when I order something online and find out they use Purolator.They and FEDEX never actually try to deliver anything to condos.  I am constantly finding ""We tried to deliver and you weren't here"" notes on my condos door with dates and times I KNOW I was home.   Unlike UPS and Canada Post who actually try to contact you through the complex intercom. To make it worse, Purolator and FedEx make you go out to the airport to pick up your package if undelivered.   UPS and Canada Post have local drop off/pick up points within a few blocks of my home.    Just terrible service.Date of experience: December 16, 2016"
4180,Jeff Bezoos,"Pretty bad, but not the worstI had my replacement Fitbit shipped with Purolator. I was pretty skeptical since I've heard so much crap about them, but ot wasn't too bad. Package was supposed to arrive in 7-14 business days and it arrived at my door after just 1 day. Only downfall I had was that the idiot delivery man left the package outside in -20 degree weather and didn't even ring the doorbell. After letting the Fitbit thaw for a few days, it worked fine so I guess it's whatever. Overall Purolater is a pretty bad company but it wasn't as bad as people said it was. It's miles and miles better than Canada Post though. Maybe I just got lucky.Date of experience: December 16, 2016"

4183,Jay Rose,"Terrible service.Waited for a package for next day delivery. It was snowing but it wasn't like the city stopped moving. By 4 pm I start to make inquiries, as the status says 'on truck for delivery' ( at 8 am!) and it has still not showed up - the distance from the depot to me is 5km! I am put on hold repeatedly for a total of 1 hour. When I do finally talk to a customer service rep I am given no info aside from excuses. They actually have no idea where their trucks are or what they are doing. At 6 pm they are closed, and tracking status says 'delayed by weather'. I wonder if they are even in the same city - Canada Post's truck makes it to my place. So now my next day delivery is scheduled for Monday. Next day delivery...oh, plus three extra days. They can't even tell me when I might expect it. No info, no solution and they said my package wasn't 'important enough' to allow me to pick it up. Completely amateur service that ignores your inquiries. I suspect when Monday arrives they won't show up. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR ANYTHING!!!!!

I mean, why do you confirm if you know it's NOT confirmed?! I ordered a phone on Nov 27, it got picked up by Purolator on Nov 29 in Mississauga/Toronto. TWICE it was ""delayed in transit due to missed connection"" and finally reached Montreal on Dec 01 (it's 7h drive from Toronto to Montreal). I was at work so they couldn't deliver. I contacted them the same day, at 2:30 pm asking to change the pick-up location to a place close to my work. Agent CONFIRMED it is done/confirmed and my parcel will be there on Dec 2.

I had four phone calls, one website live chat with Purolator, and two live chat with Amazon attempt to resolve the issue but I still not getting the package today on Nov-14.Purolator tries to let me drive 12km long to get the package half city away, and passes a bridge twice which needs to pay for the tolls.When having a phone call with Purolator, the customer representative is really rude which keeps talking without listening to me, they no nothing about their system and treat you as fool which didn't help.Finally I convince Purolator to send those packages to local store, hopefully they arrives tomorrow.Nov 14, 2016    4:19 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter.Nov 14, 2016    12:39 a.m.      Halifax, NS     Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter.Nov 12, 2016    8:46 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter.Nov 10, 2016    5:23 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter.Nov 10, 2016    3:20 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Arrived at sort facilityNov 10, 2016    3:00 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Delayed in transit due to missed connectionNov 10, 2016    2:10 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Arrived at sort facilityNov 9, 2016     2:55 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Arrived at sort facilityNov 9, 2016     2:47 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Delayed in transit due to missed connectionNov 9, 2016     1:47 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Arrived at sort facilityNov 8, 2016     5:33 p.m.       Moncton, NB     Arrived at sort facilityNov 7, 2016     5:12 p.m.       Toronto Sort Ctr/ctr Tri, ON    Departed sort facilityNov 7, 2016     3:51 p.m.       Toronto Sort Ctr/ctr Tri, ON    Arrived at sort facilityNov 7, 2016     3:50 p.m.       Toronto Sort Ctr/ctr Tri, ON    Picked up by PurolatorNov 7, 2016     8:18 a.m.       Purolator       Shipping label created with reference(s): *********----------Nov 14, 2016    4:19 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter.Nov 14, 2016    12:39 a.m.      Halifax, NS     Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter.Nov 12, 2016    8:46 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter.Nov 10, 2016    5:23 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter.Nov 10, 2016    3:22 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Arrived at sort facilityNov 10, 2016    3:00 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Delayed in transit due to missed connectionNov 10, 2016    1:12 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Arrived at sort facilityNov 9, 2016     2:20 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Shipment scheduled for delivery next business dayNov 9, 2016     2:20 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Resolution required - please contact usNov 9, 2016     1:08 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Address correction required - incomplete / incorrect address providedNov 8, 2016     7:48 p.m.       Halifax, NS     Address correction required - no entry codeNov 8, 2016     11:51 a.m.      Halifax, NS     On vehicle for deliveryNov 8, 2016     6:11 a.m.       Halifax, NS     Arrived at sort facilityNov 8, 2016     5:29 a.m.       Halifax Airport/aeroport, NS    Arrived at sort facilityNov 7, 2016     11:17 p.m.      Hamilton Airport/aeroport, ON   Departed sort facilityNov 7, 2016     10:15 p.m.      Hamilton Airport/aeroport, ON   Arrived at sort facilityNov 7, 2016     10:14 p.m.      Hamilton Airport/aeroport, ON   Picked up by PurolatorNov 7, 2016     6:44 p.m.       Purolator       Shipping label created with reference(s): *********Date of experience: November 14, 2016"
4223,Janine S,"Horrible delivery serviceThey often lie about why a package can't be delivered. I was told the road was closed (not true) and that the address was incorrect (not true- Canada Post has delivered to my address in the past with no trouble). They must hire lazy and incompetent people.When they do deliver a package they leave it out on the front porch for everyone to see, even when we have a mailbox at the other door. Very unsafe delivery service. Canada Post is so much better than they are. I hope Amazon drops Purolator. Purolator doesn't even rank one star- I wish I could give less.Date of experience: November 10, 2016"
4224,Neil Waters ,"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE - THEY DON'T CARE!!!!!!!!Tracking number: CGK000740564 (PRIORITY SHIPPING)Name: Neil WatersTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:I am very frustrated and upset about the increasingly BAD customer service that I have received today from PUROLATOR STAFF AND MANAGEMENT. I had ordered some items from AMAZON.CA and paid a high cost for PRIORITY SHIPPING. On 11/05/2016, at 08h03(am), I received a call with an automated message to let me know that my parcel is at an office 30 minutes by car (from my home) asking me to come and pick it up.(I wondered why no one had come to my doorstep to deliver this parcel, when I paid such a high cost for delivery, plus I always have someone at home and the security guard downstairs at the gates was also informed to let any PUROLATOR personnel in for delivery)I called the PUROLATOR number and spoke to a (very busy and dis-interested agent) at 11h31(am) (her name was LAURA or LORNA) and inquired with her why the package was not delivered to my doorstep, she told me that she did not know and there was an error that may have been made with regards to delivery.I inquired with her where the package was and she gave me the address. I told her that I would go and pick it up - SHE SAID OKAY! AND FAILED TO TELL ME THAT THE LOCATION WAS CLOSED!I drove all the way to the LOCATION and it was in fact CLOSED. I drove all the way back.On my way back, I called PUROLATOR one more time and spoke to another busy and dis-interested agent JAQUES and he told me that there was nothing that he could do for me. Basically, HE DID NOT CARE about the inconvenience that was caused to me and all the time and energy and GAS I wasted in the travel.I asked for his manager or supervisor, after about 10 minutes of waiting on hold. A supervisor name CINDY came on LINE.....CINDY WAS THE WORST, SHE DID NOT CARE OR GIVE A DAMN FROM THE WORD GO, SHE BASICALLY TOLD ME THAT SHE CANNOT DO ANYTHING FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE THAT WAS CAUSED TO ME.SHE TOLD ME SHE CANNOT GIVE ME ANY COMPENSATION...SHE DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE!ALL SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD ARRANGE FOR DELIVERY NEXT WEEK TUESDAY AND THAT'S IT!I informed her 3 - 4 times about the inconvenience that was caused to me and explained to her that if the agent would have told me that the LOCATION was CLOSED, it would have saved me a lot of trouble!!!!BASICALLY SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING AND KEPT REPEATING HERSELF THAT THE PACKAGE WOULD BE SENT NEXT WEEK TUESDAY.CINDY, IS THE WORST SUPERVISOR I HAVE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH, SHE WAS INCONSIDERATE, DID NOT EMPATHIZE AND JUST DID NOT GIVE A DAMN!!!! BASICALLY WANTING ME GO AWAY (indirectly)All she said was, she will follow up with the agent who spoke to me and make sure that future customers are not affected! I explained to her that this would not help me as I was already affected and severe inconvenience was caused to me!CINDY COMPLETELY IGNORED ME!!!!!!!!I was expecting a resolution and she did not give me one! The worst part is CINDY did not care, did not want to waste time on me and ABOVE ALL DID NOT APOLOGIZE AND DID NOT SHOW ANY CONCERN!This is the worst experience that I have had, we, as customers pay so much for shipping and handling and I must say that I am a very dis-satisfied customer.I would like someone to reach out to me with a resolution as soon as possible.Thank you, Neil 647 457 0045Date of experience: November 05, 2016"

4227,Suzanne Laurin-Seale,"awesome delivery guyMy initial experience with the company was questionable because every time they transferred my call it was to the wrong dept.  I suspect the actual phone system is to blame because everything else has been terrific.  I am a small business and needed a fair amount of assistance for a big order going to the USA... the support service was stellar.  I really felt like they cared.  After talking to 6 different support members 5 out of 6 were amazing, more than helpful, friendly, and solved my problems;  which were multiple.  I am so grateful to everyone for helping us out and to get this shipment out.  The driver Amud (hope I got his name right) was the Star of the day, like a human angel.  He saved my bacon!  I tried to give him a big tip and he wouldn't take it.  Management should promote him.    Thanks so much to him and Purolator.   Customer service is the most important thing and I REALLY appreciate that the jobs are kept in the country and not overseas!!!  that's enough reason to use Purolator.Sincerely, Suzanne @  Natural Beauty Skincare®Date of experience: October 21, 2016"
4228,Alexander Gosselin,"No door tag, item sent back to France.I had my parcel shipped through Chronopost from France. When it arrived in Canada, they shipped it the rest of the way via Purolator. I had to call their office in Montreal to get the tracking number - but too late. The item had apparently been here in Vancouver for a week, and Shipped back to Chronopost's Montreal Office yesterday. It's still in transit right now. It would have been nice to get a door tag from Purolator, but I guess they were too busy. The parcel is still in Purolator's posession, but they best they could do for me was to give me a complaint number for the driver. WHAT USE IS A COMPLAINT NUMBER TO ME? I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR DRIVER. Other than that, all they can tell me is OH WELL, TOO BAD.Date of experience: October 19, 2016"
4229,S Dunphy,"DeliveryPurolator is the worst delivery service in Ontario.For the third time the driver did not deliver because of the excuse could not find street number.I can tell you none of the other delivery companies have a problem finding my townhouse,even the pizza guy and the paper delivery does not have a problem.I will never ever use Purolator again.I wonder where management at Purolator don't address this problem.Dont they read the thousands of bad reviews on line.Having worked in the transportation industry for 30 years and done home delivery in various jobs, lazy incompetent drivers did not have a job very long if they performed a work ethic like this.Purolator I have a question for you,what if it was a customer waiting for medical supplies.Date of experience: October 14, 2016"
4230,ana Cser,"Absolutely horrendous experienceI've never had good experiences with this courier company and sadly I never know which courier my online order will come with otherwise I would never ever deal with Purolator. But this experience tops the cake! Last year in November I ordered a crib from babies r us. I was 8 months pregnant and exhausted from walking around so I thought I'd save myself and my hubby another trip to the store! I paid $150 for the delivery and my delivery was delayed 3 times due to ""purolator needed 2 people to deliver, as the item was over 150lbs"" as per customer service! Okay, sure. Whatever, I get it. Heavy item. Finally after talking to  customer support a few times we agreed on a date where I would stay home from work for the item to be delivered. That day, I get a call from downstairs of my condo and the purolator guy says very rudely ""I got your package, can you bring a dolly and you or someone else has to come help me it's heavy"". I explained I was pregnant and no one was home. I was not about to wait another 3 weeks for this package so I asked my neighbor who thankfully had a dolly and picked up the package. He brought it up himself without the help of the delivery guy. First of all, a lot can be learned here purolator. Like, plan ahead for big packages and equip your staff with tools to carry heavy packages. But as for customer service? Your whole staff needs a 4 week course in simple etiquette and empathy. I can't believe I paid $150 for your horrible service not to mention took a day off work!!Date of experience: October 11, 2016"
4231,Donna Leon,"STAY AWAY FROM PUROLATOR!I set up a small business account in July and used Purolator twice since then.  The first time, I shipped three boxes across the country.  The goods were in moving boxes, packed tightly, labelled and sealed securely with packing tape.  When we viewed them upon delivery, two were torn open and clothes were falling out.  I couldn't believe the poor condition!  It's as if they had been tossed off a truck at high speed. Strike one.Three weeks ago, I sent a computer in an electronics box (which I bought from UPS, as Purolator does not have any supplies of that nature).  Not only was it in a proper electronics box, but we also went the extra mile by wrapping it a great deal of bubble wrap purchased at the UPS store. It was so secure inside that box that no harm should have ever come to it. The computer, an older Mac Book Pro, worked perfectly and was to be used by my son, who required a Mac for a Computer Sciences course at university.  It arrived in Halifax with a dent in the metal casing, and a screen that was in hundreds of pieces.  It was unusable.  Couldn't even be repaired.  The value was $300.  Purolator's Claims Specialist rejected the claim because 'the computer was not in its manufacturer's packaging'.  So if we had shipped it in the Mac box, which was much flimsier than the UPS electronics box, the claim would have been accepted?!  And to add insult to injury, the surly clerk at the Purolator office in Kitchener allowed me to purchase insurance for that $300 value, even though technically, one cannot insure used goods such as that if not in original packaging. She also knew what I was shipping, and said nothing at the time. Purolator is not 'there for me', as they slogan states.  Their shippers clearly don't give a hoot about customer service.  I am closing out my small business account.  I should not be surprised.  91% owned by Canada Post. Same attitude, same poor service.  Save yourself and your goods. Go elsewhere!

4232,Tenby Lloyd,"Absolutely awfulFor three days now my package has been out for delivery, and not delivered. THREE days in a row, the driver ran out of time and couldn't deliver it.If you aren't able to deliver a package due to time constraints, then those missed packages should take priority the next day. THREE DAYS later and there's still no time.And when I call to complain, I find out that only 10 packages were missed. So for 3 days they just couldn't be bothered to deliver those few packages? Absolutely unacceptable. And now it's a long weekend... so another 3 days...Why do I bother paying for faster shipping when it's over a week late?Will NEVER be using purolator again, and will now only order from companies that use a different shipping service.Date of experience: October 08, 2016"
4233,Anthony Glazebrook,"Why do Amazon use them?We were expecting a package but Purolator didn't deliver it because they ""didn't have access to the front door"".

The next day I got a call from Purolator telling me they cannot deliver the birthday gift since it's ""dangerous item"".. what?! Really? And they said they cannot bring it back since they don't have my physical address which is ridiculous because I gave my address while sending the parcel! Anyway,I patiently gave them my address again and asked them what approximate time of delivery will be. I never got an answer, just ""sometime tomorrow"" so it means I have to sacrifice my day sitting tight at home waiting for them?! Anyway, I missed them coming just another 10minutes,so I phoned back and asked if they can send the driver back. They rejected! Even though he was just here! I've been told that only medication package is worth coming back and I can pick it up myself whenever I can... Very unprofessional and rude,the whole story from the beginning to an end.

Driver could not deliver because road was closed. Road was not closed I was in all day . Driver could not deliver because address was wrong. No it was not . Spoke to a manager asked parcel to be delivered elsewhere. However it would cost me. . Asked parcel to be sent to one of your collection points . Walked the 2 miles to collection point and no parcel . Call customer service and well the results from your customer service is a good old fashioned we don't give a sh*#* because we have your money.

4243,Clement Manuelpillai,"Absolutely the worst courier service in Canada.I shipped a server on Sept 6 from Toronto to Halifax for a next day delivery. I paid $266.44 for this and promised it will be there the very next day. I shipped it on Sept 6. I flew to Halifax on Sept 8, Thursday to setup and configure it. I found the server wasn't delivered on Wednesday as promised. When I called I was informed it was lost in transit and they were looking for it. I waited till Monday, Sept 12 for them to find it and was told it was lost and asked me to put an insurance claim which I did. On Sept 14 i received an email stating the server was found in Brunswick and they will ship it to Halifax same day. Today is Sept 20 and I am still waiting for the server. When I call or email asking for it all I get  is, it is in transit and they will let me know.It has been 14 days since I shipped this 5' long, 4' wide 20 lbs box, and paid for a next day delivery, which I can't imagine how can they lose it in the first place, and still hasn't been delivered.

Then the package was handed off to UPS where it was no where mentioned that a alternate carrier would complete the service. if your paying that kind of money to have something shipped you would expect a direct route not a loop around. at this point i was better off paying for a flight and delivering the pieces to the director himself.Date of experience: September 17, 2016"

I asked to speak with a manager and she declined. She assured me I would be contacted ASAP. I was not contacted so I called back 4 hours later. This rep was much more empathetic and friendly but still was unable to resolve or even answer questions that I had regarding why my package is ""delayed"" or ""sorting error"".

In today's world there is absolutely no way someone does not have a cellphone on them. In regard to the possibility that this is a policy, it's also a very short sighted policy in today's society. The purpose of delivery is so that I don't have to wait until 7PM to drive across town to pick up my package, frankly quite shi**y service. I'll be requesting any future purchases from online vendors avoid Purolator.Date of experience: August 29, 2016"

I work at home, I'm there 24/7...Once I found the fail to deliver slip in my mailbox in the lobby. Another time at my door.. twice more, I got no slip and found out online... I believe the drivers are lazy. instead of carrying up the package they just grab a failure slip and stick it on the door or in the mail without bringing in the package and claim no one was home...I never had one failure with Canada Post or UPS. But the failure rate for Purolator is mathematically impossible. Your customers are getting screwed if you use this delivery service. You pay for a ""at the door"" service and your customer will never receive the package and will have to fork out extra dough to go get it themselves, gas or cab expense.Date of experience: August 11, 2016"

4265,Daniel R. Page,"Put off my vacation for a package, comes the same day I leave the province, Purolator had no idea where my stuff wasI urge big stores like Best Buy to stop using Purolator, it is ridiculous.  So for a story: I preordered months ago two copies of a new video game (Monster Hunter Generations) for my girlfriend and myself.  When I had preordered them, I was under the assumption they were going to come with Canada Post, boy I was wrong. Best Buy swapped for Purolator due to the vice on the postal service.  I live in London, so Mississauga (where the shipments come from) is about 3 hours away, so it is expected to come within 1-2 business days (that is the way it always has been with Canada Post for us, we order from them quite often because I have a very busy schedule).  Didn't come until the following week (and even then, they came when nobody was here so my gf while I was gone had to take a very obscure bus to get it the following week after I left), the very day I was leaving (which I intentionally picked so I would have my copy so I could at least keep my girlfriend company while I am gone).  Since the game was sold out almost everywhere, it was very hard to find 2 local copies (fortunately I did), but now I got 2 extra copies I have to return because a certain company couldn't do their basic responsibilities to delivery electronics quickly as expected (because you know, that's the point of a preorder).    When I contacted Purolator, they could not provide me any information on my shipment at all, and told me to contact Best Buy.  Best Buy didn't know anything and it took them at least a week to track it down, and by that point it by happenstance was coming that day.  Absolutely absurd service, and will not order from any company that uses Purolator.  Due to their delivery policies I wasted maybe 3 days of my work week waiting around for something that wasn't coming, which is a huge penalty for me because I do scientific research (where every day counts).Date of experience: July 31, 2016"
4266,Sam,"The Worst Courier in the History of MankindIn the last few months, I've had to deal with Purlolator as it unfortunately remains to be Dell's courier of choice, and at this point, without fear of contradiction, I can rate them as consistently substandard.Inferior quality plagues all aspects of this two-bit company's services. Without exception, every single package handled by them has been a frustrating experience infested with enormous delays only worsened by unacceptable excuses, a chaotic website with outdated and inaccurate information, rude agents accompanied by irrational supervisors, and lazy drivers who can't or won't even read the buzzer code displayed in plain site on the entrance of the building, send the package to a remote depot, and then have the audacity to demand that the buzzer code has to be included in the address label. This shameless group of incompetent people have taken irresponsibility to a new level. Their allegedly low prices perfectly reflect their incredibly low quality. In a nutshell, this cheap courier service has to be avoided at all costs, even if your life depended on it. If you can't afford a proper courier, do yourself a favor and send your package by regular mail.  The chances are that it will reach its destination days, perhaps weeks, before the purely pathetic Purolator can deliver. Unless you insist on wasting your money, time and energy, SAY NO TO PURELATOR. Help bring them down to their knees so they either shape up or preferably ship out, leaving the job to the real professionals who know what they're doing and treat your with a modicum of respect.Date of experience: July 29, 2016"

Meanwhile sony and purlator centre is located an hour away. Thats not the biggest problem. The day after it was on vehicle for delivery with estimated day the day after and nothing. I literally sat at home all day waiting for nothing to have at 11:59 that day for it to change to say not available.

I say I want to pick it up Saturday. She says that's fine, they will put in the request and my tracking info will update.Friday it's a day before I'm going to pick it up. No update. I talk to an agent again, this time on LiveChat. Agent says yes the package will be ready for you to pick up tomorrow. Saturday I go to pick it up and wait for 30 minutes. Guess what? No, package is not available.On Monday the tracking information is updated to Address correction required - incomplete / incorrect address provided after ""Arrived at sort facility,"" ""Departed sort facility,"" ""Picked up by Purolator,"" ""Arrived at sort facility,"" ""Delayed in transit"" -- all on Monday.So I contacted an agent again to clarify the issue and she says the address needs to be corrected to match my ID.

It sat in Toronto for several days, inexplicably delayed in transit,  and most recently has been scanned 5 time as 'Arrived' in Ottawa.  After escalating it, someone called and asked if it was an envelope or a box?? Shouldn't they know...then he asked what was in it??  Why does that matter...So Amazon tells me to order another one with overnight service and I do.  Now that one is lost as well.  First, I have to say Amazon has been great about responding to me and refunding shipping costs but I still don't have the thing I ordered, which is what I really care about...not the money.Purolator claims everything is due to increased volume (blaming a potential postal strike) but frankly that is not my problem.  They continue to take packages and people's money without any accountability.  If they can't meet the most basic delivery services because they are 'too busy' then they should shut down and re-organize before taking another single package.I encourage Amazon, and ALL companies, to drop them as a delivery service and it is time for the Canadian people to get out of the delivery business and sell that ridiculous crown corporation.Date of experience: July 22, 2016"
4283,Gerry,"Complete Logistical Failure...There seems to be a major issue with delivery/courier companies servicing lower mainland of BC. I had an item sent from the States through the other company...the one with the big brown trucks?...They took 21 days to get it here from less than 800 miles away...then they delivered it to a business 3 blocks away. The person there told them it was the wrong address but the driver just said ""it seemed like the right number"" to him.So I went with Purolator this time. The item shipped from Saskatoon to Vancouver in just over two days. The item was scheduled for delivery on the 14th. It is a home improvement item that I need a tradesman to install so I booked one for the 15th with the proviso that the item is available. As you can guess the 14th came and suddenly the expected delivery date changed...late in the day to ""unknown"". I tried calling on 4 occasions all totaled 5 hours on hold...each time the phone would just go dead after about an hour and 15 minutes. During this time you hear how you can improve your business by using Purolator so your customers can track the items you are shipping them. Amazingly ironic.Tried e-mail..no reply...live chat..no staff available. I even tried to go in the back door to talk with someone about shipping a new item...no answer.How does this company stay in business?My company measures customer wait times in 3 second intervals...3 seconds...these guys think within a week is close enough.They ""attempted"" to deliver item today...my wife was at home...heard nothing...she went out front to water plants and there on the door is a delivery notification. The item is about 7 km from the house. It has probably been there for a week but I am only being told of it now.Obviously they are working their staff hard if they can't answer a call in more than an hour or take the time to actually wait for someone to answer their door.Hey Purolator...I will send you payment through your own company...it may or may not get there...Date of experience: July 22, 2016"

You are at home, waiting all day long, after having given them all the requested information (address and phone number, of course) and still will not receive any parcel!I even left a note on the door of the building telling the courier to call me maybe from his personal phone, that I would hang up and call him right back. Guess what: he wrote ""no phone"" on my note. What kind of delivery company has no phones allowed for its employees? Then, no one is answering the client phone number on their site. Finally, after a couple of days, you find out that ""you weren't at home"" and you have to go to their warehouse to pick up your parcel.I will not buy anything else on the internet before asking which is the shipment company.

4295,am,"No package after almost a monthI ordered a package on June 28th (the shipping warehouse was only a couple hours from my house). The delivery date was listed as June 30th. On July 14th I began to question where my package is. My tacking information shows the package had no moved since July 5th (9 days without moving?). I emailed twice with no answer (their website states you will receive a response within 48 hours), I have called numbers times, no answer. I even tried the ""live chat"" option; again, no answer. On July 17th, I tracked my package again and the information said that there was an attempted delivery on Saturday July 16th, with no answer. However, i did not receive an attempted delivery slip. If no one answered Saturday, would the company not attempt to deliver the next business day? Monday July 18th there was someone at my house all day, no attempted delivery. Again, I have called, emailed, attempted to live chat with no answer.As it has been almost a month since the specified delivery date and i have not been able to get a hold of a single person I am beginning to think I will never see my package. I have never had such an awful experience shipping a package. I will never use Purolator again, nor will I recommend anyone else use this company to ship their items.Date of experience: July 18, 2016"
4296,Alice,"Worst service experience in my life!Where do I even begin... I ordered more branded packaging for my business because I am participating in a 12 day trade show in my city. Order with priority shipping because I knew I would need it ASAP. It's now 6 days over due. I'm literally sitting here at the trade show, half way over, missing half of my product line because of this. I called their customer service line, 2 hour wait. All the rep could tell me is to keep waiting? I'm losing thousands of dollars of revenue and that's all you've got for me? Even refused to refund shipping, which I've never heard of in my life. Other companies refund if they're even a day late. I order things with UPS and FedEx on the same days and got them EARLY. I can understand them being swamped because of the potential lock out with Canada Post, but this is excessive. I got the rep to get someone in the tracking department call me and, and that rep told me they have 9,200 units in my city waiting in their warehouse, and that it would be at least a few more biz days before I got it. All I could do was laugh. So you're telling me, my business is going to suffer big time, AND you won't refund me the shipping. If I conducted business this way, I'd be long out of business... I don't know how they are still around. Part of me is kicking myself saying I should have ordered sooner, but if I had used another shipper, I would have received it all a week ago! 0 stars. Don't bother calling because it will waste your time. They will do nothing to help you. Keep waiting, and never use Purolator again.Date of experience: July 18, 2016"

I can see how they had a problem with it as the address has only been here for 35 years, and no one else has ever had problems delivering to this address. Naturally no one can be reached, no one manning the contact us phones, no one on the 'chat' link. Oh, if that's not enough, we have had the same issue with Purlator FIVE TIMES now- this address very much exists and each time message is the same (how does Amazon.ca use these guys as their delivery company?).Date of experience: July 18, 2016"

It's been almost a week and I still don't have my package even though I paid for premium shipping. It's from Mississauga to Scarborough for god's sake. How long does it really need to take? I did have other packages from Dynamex and CanPar (which I was really uncertain because never heard about these folks)  but it turns out they are very reliable and the shipments arrived on time as promised.

The package from Vancouver arrived a day early on Friday, and the package from Toronto IS STILL SITTING IN A GODDAMN WAREHOUSE  SOMEWHERE IN MONTREAL, WHICH ONE WAS SHIPPED USING PUROLATOR?Yeah, terrible company.

Purolator has essentially just stolen whatever I needed shipped, they have my package and refuse to communicate where it is or when I will receive it. I'm just thankful what I ordered wasn't business sensitive otherwise I'd be completely screwed.

4319,Me,"One word: TerribleThis was the first time I had ever used Purolator and it was the worst shipping experience I've ever had. A week ago I was due to get a delivery to my apartment and according to the online tracking system they had tried to deliver my item but did not have the buzzcode - my fault for not leaving it, however I received neither a call nor email (I thought this info is also given for this reason?) from the delivery person as they attempted to get into the building (if this is not possible, my apologies for thinking so).After learning it had not been delivered, I tried to figure out how to remedy the situation. I sent an email asking how to change the address, but over 48 hours later, no response. I tried to open a live chat multiple times but no agents were available. I tried to call but was left on hold for an hour and I eventually had to hang up.The next day I headed to the depot on Yonge and Adelaide to try and figure out where it was. After initially being told my item was in fact at this location, I was then informed it was at the Kipling location and they could get it shipped to this location. I asked if it could be delivered to my work address the day after, and left all the details on a piece of paper. I also left my number and email in case anything went wrong.The day after (today as I write this review) I opened up the online tracking system to find the incorrect street number was given. I called the Yonge Adelaide location to find the wrong street number had been entered into the system - after leaving them the details. No email or phone call either.It is meant to arrive tomorrow - hopefully it does!TLDR; couldn't initially find where my item had gone after the delivery went wrong, had no idea how to find out, and then wrong info was entered when I went in person to update the street address.Date of experience: July 13, 2016"
4320,Jared Christie,"My 4 horrible experiences with PurolatorI'm a 3D modeler who needs a good computer to render out short movies and it speeds up my work flow so I upgrade my computer about every two years. Newegg ships through Purolator.My first shipment was a Thor V2 computer case and I knew that the Purolator truck was supposed to arrive that day. At night I checked if it was still on the way but it said missed delivery when they never showed up so I had to go and pick it up myself.Second delivery was a Geforce 4GB GTX 980 which costs around $750 canadian. I waited by the front door for a couple of days and when checking online I noticed that it had said that it was delivered a couple of days ago. So my worries are that a) the delivery person went to the wrong house or b) they put it into the system that they had tried delivering it when they really didn't.Third was I was picking up some headphones for my sisters work that costs $120. The delivery driver put the box by the front door, rang the door bell and was driving away as I went outside to pick up the parcel. The two issues is that 1) the delivery driver was going to leave the box there for anyone to pick up, 2) it was raining which would've destroyed the headphones if I wasn't there to take it out of the rain immediately.Fourth experience is I ordered a GTX 1070 from newegg which is shipping from the US. I placed in my order for express delivery but it has been a week now waiting for my package. So I went onto some online forums and found a Purolator representative who said, ""Hello, This is Jeremie with Purolator Customer Care. Generally, shipments sent from Newegg are sent ground while transiting in the US and enter Canada through one of our Gateway terminals. From that point, if your shipment was sent express, your package should arrive overnight (depending on geographical restrictions). ""When shipping from the United States, don't expect your money to ship your parcel across the United States any faster then it originally would if you pay the original price. Even when it gets into Canada, they are careful not to guarentee that you will receive it the next day.

They have said they're a little busier but haven't had ANY problems with deliveries. The ups guy whp delivered to me today even agreed they have had multiple inquiries as to whether people can switch from purolator to ups to go pick up packages purolator cant seem to handle (ups doesnt do that unfortunately). The company I ordered from (amazon) had to reship me a new package (using canada post which is set to deliver even before purolator can get the original package to me) and now I'm forced to wait around for purolator to get the package to me just so I can ship it back since I got a new delivery with a different delivery service.

4340,James,"Come on!I wanted to have a package delivered to downtown montreal but of course I wasn't home at the time because I work during the day so naturally purolator goes and leaves it a pick-up depot. But apparently the most appropriate depot is 15km away in Lachine rather than any sort of depot in montreal. I don't have a car so it would cost me far more than the contents of the package just to go pick it up. So I tried calling customer service to see if they could do something about it but of course they were  ""experiencing a higher than usual call volume"" so I waited for over 40 minutes until I just gave up.Date of experience: July 07, 2016"
4341,Mark G,"Absolutely terribleTerrible. I live in Toronto, and they want me to drive to Vaughan to get my shipment, which is terrible since I don't have a car and the package is quite heavy; all this because the delivery was cancelled - I got a day off from work only to wait for this shipment. The next day I had to work and I missed the delivery - of course, they only try delivering once.Their customer service is basically non-existent. I tried using the Live Chat and it doesn't work (I can never get an available agent), I tried calling, but spent over 15 minutes on the phone without getting an answer.This company is just a nightmare, do you want to get a taste of hell?

Now, it's a 20 degree, sunny as hell day, and guess what? Apparently weather is too dangerous to deliver in, and it's gonna be the next day.

Immediately he gets frustrated and rudely tells me that he's done at 4:00 so when is it going to be ready? First of all.. why would Purolator let me put in that pickup time if they cant pick anything up after 4:00???! So I say okay give me one sec I just need to print one more thing out and it will be ready (the time is still before my requested pick up time). As soon as I start walking away I hear him grunt and slam something down on the counter as he is clearly angry. By the time I get back and put the envelope together it hasn't even been 1 minute. I give him the envelope and he rudely walks out.. Anyway obviously this is totally unprofessional.. always have issues with Purolator.. I don't know what they are thinking when they hire staff..

4350,jeremy,"AVOID AT ALL COSTSThe absolute worst shipping service I've ever used! Never again!- They did not even attempt to deliver the package. They just left a tag at the door without even checking if anyone was home to receive, then immediately drove off.- When I went to pick it up the next day (at my own inconvenience -- I thought I paid for a delivery?), the clerk REFUSED to give me my parcel, even though she had it right there in her hands. I showed my ID. The name on the parcel matched. I told her who and where it came from, as well as the contents of the parcel. But for some reason that she couldn't properly explain, she thought it did not belong to me. I still have no idea why.- My request to speak with her management was blatantly ignored. I asked that she herself contact her superior instead then, but was ignored. My request for a direct line to customer service was denied, and I was instead given the generic, automated line where you have to sit through 30 minutes of pre-recorded nonsense. This got me nowhere and I gave up.- She requested that I show her an email confirmation to prove it belonged to me. I did not have an email confirmation because this was a personal package sent from a friend. We don't use commercial shipping software or send each other confirmation emails! - Ultimately, for her to *finally* believe it was my package, I had to show her a PERSONAL EMAIL CONVERSATION between myself and the sender. This is blatantly intrusive and unprofessional, but I saw no other choice. So nearly an hour after I arrived, she had finally relented the parcel to me... right before telling me to ""have a great day"" in a sarcastic tone. I happen to manage a large commercial shipping department, and I've dealt with all manner of mishaps, shipping errors, and customer service problems. But this simple little personal delivery trumps them all. I'm discontinuing my company's use of Purolator based on this experience.

4353,Mr. Not Amused,"Lost Shipment Worth Nearly $300Purolator has lost my shipment and refuses to take any responsibility for it. I bought a TV monitor on Amazon.ca and the shipping was supposed to be done by Purolator.  I took an entire day off so I can receive it personally and I was periodically checking the tracking number online.At around 14:00, I saw that the shipment was supposedly delivered at 12:37, so I went outside to check if it was unceremoniously dumped on my doorstep, but there was nothing there.  I immediately contacted their Customer department and was assigned a tracking case. I was told that their ""tracking specialist"" Mary Leblanc will send me an email soon.When I finally received her email, I noticed immediately that she barely could speak English. She told me that she will contact the driver as soon as possible. It took an entire week to get a reply from her, and when she did, she told me that the driver delivered the shipment to the proper address and the case is closed. Even if the driver told the truth (which is doubtful) and he did deliver the shipment to my address, he never notified me in any way. There was no doorbell or even a knock on the door.  In the 1.5 hour window between it was supposedly delivered and when I checked the front door, someone apparently stole the shipment.

My husband is in quite a bit of pain and discomfort and now has to wait for Canada Post to deliver the parcel which MAY arrive by THURSDAY!  Totally UNACCEPTABLE service (or rather, disservice).

OH.....tacking # is 330752553488. When I checked the Tracking option of Purolator, they said the parcel was picked up on MONDAY, June 6th at 14:53.  The pick up point is approximately a 3-hour drive to our location and we are STILL waiting.  Also, no mention was made on your tracking site of the fact that Purolator 'dropped the parcel off at Canada Post.

However, the driver did not knock the door and he just dropped the note for me to pick up while I was in my room.

I said I just moved in and I haven't got to change my address on the license, but with the matching name and my photo it should be oaky because it would work for EVERY OTHER COMPANY. The clerk kept asking me to show a prof of billing information which with my name and address, but I didn't have any since I JUST MOVED IN. So she refused to give me my package. She said even with my landlord's photo ID with her address on it and my ID with my name would not work. I knew it was not her fault but I just felt their rules were crap.

4357,Christopher Turner,"Horrible ExperienceOver the years I've had many problems with Purolator. There's the socially-inept driver who intentionally slipped the paper into my window saying I wasn't home for a delivery while I was in the kitchen, once. I watched him come up, and just put the ""Missed you, come get it yourself"" paper in the door. I yelled ""Hello! I'm here!"" and he RAN OFF. I had to chase him across the parking lot, and get in front of the truck to get him to actually give me my delivery!!!! I'll say it one more time: He, instead of just giving me my package, intentionally tried to slip a note in my door and when he actually saw me coming over to get my package he RAN. I wasn't angry or anything, no idea why he would act this way. Let's see, the other time is when I wanted a two day delivery for my very important PC gear from Korea, as I had a course I was starting and needed it for. Well, it took over a month. Not only that, but it was held for a little bit in Canada Customs, and when this happens Purolator just loses track of it altogether, and doesn't know how to get it back. I spoke with Canada Customs about it - all they had to do, since they were the agents, was to contact them and continue the process. Well, they never did, they just kept asking ME who was my shipping agent. I'll repeat that - I called Purolator about my package, and they asked who was handling the shipping. That'd be you, Purolator.... So I had to go get it myself. I had to basically cancel the delivery so that I could go down to customs, in the winter, and pick it all up myself. Guess what? Loads of stuff missing from it. After going over this with Korean and Canadian Customs the blame was placed on Purolator's staff. Purolator, naturally, did nothing about it. So not only did it take over a month, not only did I have to pick it up MYSELF, but a bunch of stuff off of the list was missing and Purolator was refusing to pay for it. Purolator came by FOUR MONTHS LATER to ask for payment, saying I was late in paying. Funny, I'd explained quite clearly on the phone more than once that I wasn't paying for such a botched delivery.

I knew the parcel was expected today so traded my shift at work to have the shift off and watched movies in my living room waiting of it to arrive. Shortly after 12pm I received an email that a delivery had been attempted and I had missed it. The entire time I was home there was not a single knock on the door or doorbell wrung. At the bottom of my stairs was the attempted delivery notification (clearly they hadn't walked up the stairs to the door). I was a little frustrated at this point but figured the worst case scenario was that I could pick it up sometime in town that afternoon. After calling I was informed the earliest I could get it was Monday and I would have to either drive to a town roughly an hour away (3 days after it was suppose to arrive) or pay a fee to have it delivered sometime next week.

On another occasion I had shipped a very delicate parcel, packaged it with PVC pipe *incredibly hard to bend* and it came back 5 times damaged and mangled! FIVE TIMES! Every time taking more caution to package it well.  When i called purolator...in regards to the package that was very well marked FRAGILE. I was told that i ""obviously didn't package it properly"" and that its ""out of their control"". That marking a package fragile means nothing, because it goes on a conveyor belt and gets tossed around....Needless to say we had to pay for each shipment that came back destroyed. I have been in customer service for over 15 years and never have i treated people the way the customer service staff do at Purolator!Date of experience: February 05, 2016"

4383,Fan,"Unreliable and Unable to Meet GuaranteesWe were thoroughly disappointed with our first (and last) experience with Purolator's express shipping services. We needed an important envelope delivered by 9:00AM and Purolator guaranteed that it would arrive on time. The evening of the day our envelope was due to arrive, we received notification from Purolator saying that it, among countless others had missed its connection and was still sitting at the local warehouse. We contacted customer service and ran back and forth between shipping centres to ensure that the envelope could instead be shipped as soon as possible. We were promised that we would receive a full refund, as Purolator was unable to meet its promise, after the envelope had been delivered, but when we went to collect the refund, we were told that we couldn't have our money back because although our shipment was over a day late, it did still arrive.

I waited until the next day. Mind you I have a camera in the lobby of my building and I am watching for this delivery person. All day. He shows up with three packages in his hand. Does not use the buzzer to gain access to the building. He gains access to the building via somebody leaving the building therefor opening the door for him. I wait and no delivery arrives at my door. An hour later there's an update on my tracking status saying he had no access because I did not provide a buzzer. My buzzer does not work and that is why I did not provide one, and I explained this to them. He did not use the buzzer to enter the building, so his statement of ""No access"" is a lie. I call them and discuss the matter. I experience a rude phone call with a woman from the company. She ends up telling me ""ok we'll delivery again monday bye"" and hangs up on my rudely. Monday comes and here I am watching the camera for 2 hours (within this time the driver claims to have showed up). He says he could not gain access to the building. As I said i've been watching the camera, and this time there was NO delivery person to show up at all, rather just claiming he tried and couldnt gain access. This company is completey unreliable. I had to call them and tell them just drop off my package at the nearest pick up location since their service is a joke.

If you wanna know where your package is you can call and ask them. They seem to have an updated version. The delivery man knocked on my door and was friendly.

This place has the worst service out there.  The driver couldn't find my street and did not leave a slip on my door, but did call to let me know that and that I would need to go to the office to pick up the package.  So I went to the office and as I started to give my name to the lady at the counter, she very rudely cuts me off and says ""can't look anything up by name, need the slip.""  I very politely explain to her that I received a call that the driver couldn't find my address and didn't leave a slip.  She then says ""Too bad, can't help you"" and walks away.  Are you kidding me?  But yet somehow, magically, they could call me to let me know the driver couldn't find my house.  I get that things happen, I own a business myself, and it wasn't so much the fact the driver couldn't find my place, it was the level of customer service when I went to retrieve the package. She didn't offer any type of assistance, and was extremely rude.  If I found out one of my employees was treating customers this way, they wouldn't have a job.  Completely unacceptable.  A man working in the back came out and told me I could try contacting the company I got the package from to see if they have any tracking info.

4393,Reg,"Horrid Delivery ServiceI've been waiting to receive a package I ordered that was being shipped by ground (i.e., the slow way). The package has been in my city (Vancouver, Canada) for 5 days. They noticed a mistake on the address 5 days ago but, when they shipped it out on the truck for delivery this morning the address apparently had not yet been corrected. They made no attempt to contact me to verify the address and exercised absolutely no common sense. The postal code and building number alone should have been enough to confirm the address. They could have verified this by requesting ID when they dropped off the package or, even better, use one of those new-fangled telephone devices to check first. Also, their shipment tracking system is useless. The messages it gives probably make sense to people who work with it all the time (i.e., their staff, shipper-receivers for businesses) but not to someone who has something delivered once in a while. I'm going to ask the company that I bought this product from to switch to FedEx.

My husband keeps traveling those roads back and forth and none of the roads were closed.

Last time I had to drive 1.25 minutes to retrieve my parcel (different business). What I think is that they are lazy and don't come to certain rural areas and lie about road closures.

I opened a chat on the purolator website to find out what the deal was, and found that the driver ""did not have your phone number or buzzer number."" my phone number is clearly stated on my shipping and billing address, so maybe ebgames did not include it. My problem is that I mentioned that there was no notice on the door of my building to let me know delivery had been attempted, and was told by the chat personnel that ""purolator does not use door notices due to security concerns.""

So much so we got the system set up where we don't have to sign for the package. We've lived where we are for 14 years and have had our dog for 13 of those. Never a problem. Now they tell us that because we have a gate and we have dogs they will not deliver unless the dogs are inside and the gate is open. We live in the country and the dogs live outside. This was never a problem before as anyone unsure would call us and we were happy to come to the gate to receive our package. Now they are not allowed to carry cell phones because they can't trust their drivers to not drive distracted. That doesn't say much for their drivers. So now they want me to keep dogs inside on the off chance I have a package arriving. The least they could do is call me from their depot and tell me they are in the area so I can prepare for them as FedEx has told me they would do.

Insure you do your job and get the package from point A to point B? OK so I insure and it gets smashed again. Sorry they say, you need to have $$special handling on the weighbill. If you don't pay the nickel and dime on the package you get Drop kick service. So you do all that and then your bill comes in a lot higher than they quoted on the webship, why? oh well your weight that you declared isn't the same as the $$cube weight. But if you accidentally put too much weight and it s higher they will not adjust it down. What a scamming company. Borderline fraud. Also BEWARE don't have a fragile sticker or leave an old air tag on the box or they will just $$Charge you more again for this. $Special handling automatically for a old fragile sticker. or Worse $$$Air freight for an air sticker. Even though you specifically did not sign up for that when prepping the shipping bill. AVOID. Use Greyhound for western Canada - They are great and half the price.

4416,Carol,"Purolator desk in StaplesI would have found it convenient to use Purolator if I could have had a better response when I used their local Staples location.  There was no Purolator employee there and no one who worked for Staples would sign a receipt acknowledging that my parcel had been dropped off.  An instruction to ""just leave it laying on the counter"" is not adequate.  Anyone, customer or employee, could pick it up and I would have no proof that it had been left there.

I called back and they said the delivery was most likely not happening today so I can expect it Monday.  They did say I will receive a credit since I was not going to receive it on time.  If I wanted it Monday I would have paid regular delivery charges.  So not impressed!Date of experience: June 27, 2015"

Thanks so much, Purolator, for not telling me that my shipment was in ever, letting it sit at the [far away] depot for the normal 5 days (which is incidentally shorter than any other company) and returning it to sender! I only noticed when I looked up the tracking number, because nobody told me a thing. When I called in it hadn't been delivered back yet, but they said that there was nothing they could do and I just needed to contact the company I ordered things from.

4426,Niglin B.,"UntrustworthyThere is a known problem with Purolators laser arc system, on line at their depots (current), this results in you PAYING MUCH MORE. RE: Do you see 'adjusted weight' on your invoices? This means you are paying them more, than what you were told/saw online, and in Eship, result, you lose money; and lots of it. Example, I send a package that weighs 8 lbs, now the calculated cubed weight is actually 27.34lbs  in box with the dimensions of 21x15x10"". But, because Purolators scales/system is messed up the laser arc somehow calculates 32x22x10"". So instead of the cost being $59.34, you end up paying $115.95. This means you are out some $60 xx. This may be more of an extreme example, but it happens, and more often than you think. Anything where you see 'adjusted weight' on your invoice, means your paying more for shipping than you were told. I suggest you use another courier like Loomis etc.until they fix this problem. To date I am still battling with them on this, and they refuse to give us credits for their errors; we have lost thousands of dollars, even though I have it in writing that we will be reimbursed on adjusted weights dating back to the beginning of January 2015. PSMaybe the worst part is that they are downplaying and denying and wrong doing, the salesperson is the worst **** ever, and their billing dept. simply won't help you out.Date of experience: April 30, 2015"
4427,KB,"The worst delivery company in AlbertaI've dealt with Purolator for many years.  I never thought there would be a difference between the provinces.  I am in Ontario and every driver has been courteous and helpful, but when I have to deal with a shipment coming out of Alberta, there's always some kind of problem.  If a waybill hasn't been filled in, the driver leaves.  Yet in Ontario, if I don't have a waybill, the driver politely goes to his truck and brings one to fill in.  If you live in a condo or apartment in Alberta, good luck getting your delivery.  I've had people wait in all day for a delivery, only to be told they weren't home when Purolator delivered.  It's just that those delivery people don't like apartments.  It's ridiculous!  So now I ship to the depot closest to the person for pick up there.

4435,StelChar,"Somewhat reliable, but still very disorganized.I had packages delivered by Purolator on two separate occasions within the last 2 months (once in December, once in February). On both of these occasions I had ordered from the same seller who used Purolator as their designated delivery service (an online retailor shipping from New York, US and I am located in Barrie, Ont. CA). I'll start with the positive experience with Purolator, that being, I received both of my orders within a reasonably outlined time frame (both orders used ground shipping at no extra costs expected in 3-7 days and it came to me within 2 weeks). However, I am one of those compulsive online shoppers where I need to see where my packages are every step of the way, especially when they are on the expensive items. Well you can let that dream fly right out the window if you're going to be receiving anything from Purolator. I don't understand the point of them even having an online tracking system (1) It doesn't register the item until its in Canada which is understandable, however, it isn't registered into their system once it crosses the boarder either so for me I had no idea of where my package was for about 4-5 days (this happened on both occasions). (2) no information is provided on the item until it is at the sort facility in the area where you live, (3) your item can say ""on vehicle for delivery"" for forever...literally...I got my package yesterday and it still says online that its ""on vehicle for delivery"", so yesterday it was a surprise to see a package sitting on my porch which was expensive and could have been stolen without my knowledge since it wasn't given the status of ""delivered"". In another instance, when it was delivered it said ""delivered to reception""...which is unusual since I live at a residential address and they happened to leave it on the porch so this can be misleading, which caused me to panic and think it was delivered to the wrong address. Needless to say, aside from not having an estimated delivery date or having any real knowledge of when or where my package was to be delivered, it still managed to get to me safely. which in the end is all that matters to me.Date of experience: February 18, 2015"

I missed the first delivery cause I didn't hear the door bell. not sure they even used it. so I called them up to see if they could recall the driver to come back this was around 2:30 in the Tuesday afternoon. I was told that she could call or paged the diver to due so but can have it resent for the falling day. I Proceeded to tell here that on the wed I had to be home and there be no one to sign for the package. She told me to leave a not on the front door with all moth the package id number permission to leave the package in the door with my name both printed and signed. So I did just that (not liking that idea cause I live in a basement apartment so a note say no one home is not my ideal to leave) Thought after all that the package did not show up and online I got delayed due to miss delivery and would be delivered the next day.  So I had Thursday the next day off work so I could wait for the package. I How ever did get called twice to see if I could work 2 different shift but had to say no cause I didn't want to leave a not again stating no one was home plus the landlord who lives upstairs was not happy with the notes on the mail box as well. It was getting close to 5pm and still no package so I called Purolator for the second time to see if my package was coming at all the girl said she would page the driver and let him now I was wait for the package that did not come the day before cause she said the drive fell ill and assured me that I would get my package. So waited and cheek on line 1 hour later to see if any update and there was AGAIN delayed due to missed delivery. WHAT THE HELL!!! I then called them for a 3rd time to find out what was going on. (you would think after they didn't delivery the day before that make sure you defiantly got it the next day specially if there no acts of god preventing them to do so) Once again I was told to leave a note giving permission to leave the package to do so. After expressing my concers that I did not want to have it public on a not no one was home again and that that landlord did not want that. I even ask to have some one else bring I sure they have people delivery things tell 8pm. I ask if I could give phone permission. Answer no. Asked if she could put it in regular mail. Answer again NO. She then suggest to have it redirected to another location that would be home to sign. but because the person who could do it was in a different area that I would be charge a surcharge to do so? What they cost me a day I could have worked which I could have mad money then say if I wanted to do it that way to charge me a surcharge. I don't drive and have to work so no way I can get to there office to pick it up so stuck try to figure out this package.

The cost to send by Purolator was about $27. Purolator said the recipient was notified. The only notification was a garbled voicemail which could not be understood. Not a word of the message was clear. The recipient was pretty sure the message was not in English, so it was disregarded. Purolator also said they left a notice in the mailbox, which is a lie. Two weeks later I was called to pick up something at the Kamloops Purolator. It was the returned envelope. I later received an invoice in the mail for the return, another $27 for retuning the document which I neither wanted or asked for. You've got to be kidding!! They should send an refund, not an invoice! If not so maddening, it would be comical that they wanted to make sure I received the  invoice, so they sent it by Canada Post.

I called their  800 number and was met by rudeness from some guy in Montreal by the name of Jason. He even said that the bad weather delay was ICE and SNOW ! what a joke.

Well apparently, my package was delivered according to the tracking website.  When I went to check the front porch, there was nothing at the door.  I called the claims department to start an inquiry. What a joke!!!!  A few days later, I received an email that the driver said he delivered my package. That was the depth of their investigation and now the case was closed.  Unfortunately this was my first dealing with purolator and I was waiting for other items to be delivered by them over the following week. Well according to the businesses that use purolator delivery service, pulolator hides the packages. This is total Bulls***.  I have a large front veranda with a good 15 feet from the top of the stairs to my front door.  The rest of my packages, delivered over the course of a week, were left at the top of my stairs, out in the open for the whole neighbourhood to see.  One box, that for some reason kept being sent back to the sorting facility over the course of the week, was completely open and falling apart when it finally arrived.  I will never buy from a business that uses purolator as their delivery service.

Well they made me wait for 2 God forsaken hours. The clerks there were rude as hell yelling at me when they were the ones who had no idea where their driver was. They pledged on their wall to provide us with knowledgeable service but I only heard 3 words out of their mouths:""I don't know"". They then told me that they were closing soon and if their driver still wasn't back then I would have to come back tomorrow.

4456,Jenny,"UnprofessionalThey gave me an arrival date on a baby stroller I bought for a gift. ToysRUs didn't have it in stock at the store so they had to ship to my address which I had to pay $20 for shipping to my house.

I waited all day and asked my mother to pick up my kids from school so I could be home waiting for Purolator. I called the center and they were closed. I used live chat and was told my package was at Purolator and ready to pick up. Purolator is in a completely different city than me.

It's three pieces of furniture jammed into one box; the box is 130lbs. Best buy offers free delivery which is great because we don't have a vehicle to retrieve it ourselves.  About a week after we ordered this $500 box we got a message saying our item is in transit, which concerned us because we didn't get a call to set up a delivery date. When we called Purolator they said it was coming from Vancouver and when it arrives is toronto they will call to make the necessary arrangements.  Great.  A few days after this we checked the status of our delivery and it said delivery attempted, no one home.  Hmm, peculiar, we hadn't set the date yet. We called back and they said no problem, let's just set another date! So we did but the catch is either my wife or I has to help lift the box off the truck and into our apartment!  my wife is the only one home and also she's 9 months pregnant, so she ain't helpin'!

4465,Sidra Qureshi,"Customer Service Reps Lack Logic and Common Sense!The service I have received from Purolator the past few days has been atrocious.  Our company received an invoice with a charge that had a date from months prior – the same charge on this invoice had already been dealt with and paid for on the date in question. (Months ago, we called in to confirm this package had been delivered to the correct address on the way bill, we had actually called the day after it was shipped. We called because the package had been delivered to a different address – and we wanted to know why) Yesterday, we called Purolator regarding the charge from months ago appearing AGAIN on this new invoice - We put time and effort into slowly explaining, in detail, showing/sending proof and insisting that the customer representative review the call logs from months ago when this was settled. We tried explaining, very calmly, that ‘when we had called in (a few months ago) and spoke with a representative to inquire why this package wasn’t shipped to the correct address the rep explained that it had been redirected to the proper address, but it was delivered’  Then, the customer rep I was speaking with (yesterday) said she would email me the other package number *the package number had no way bill or anything verifying it had been sent from our company* The customer rep started emailing me, repeating the same message over and over again. I requested to speak with a supervisor. (As I had already spent half the day trying to prove that there was only one way bill and one package sent out, and that when I called in to confirm months ago that it was delivered -  this was ALREADY VERIFIED) I could not comprehend why this customer service rep was making me do all of her work? Gathering all the information she had at her finger tips, and yet was refusing to look deeper into this situation. *They have call logs for a reason, don’t they???? The supervisor contacted me the next day, repeating the same-exact- word-for-word information that the customer rep had told me the day prior. This supervisor was extremely incompetent and insisted that this was a separate ‘undeclared package’ that our company had not paid for yet (but was delivered the same time as the first package, yet it was undeclared?) She also insisted that who ever shipped it out from our shipping/receiving department must have just made a mistake and slapped a sticker on another package. I confirmed that the person who shipped it out WAS ME!?! I became VERY FRUSTRATED because I know 100% that I shipped 1 package out – it was even more frustrating because the supervisor was simply ‘assuming’ I shipped 2 packages. She then went on to say “maybe the packages were taped together” – this supervisor simply was guessing at this point.  There is still no proof of 2 different packages – our way bill says 1 of 1? We also have the invoice from months ago stating that the package was paid for already – why would we get billed on two different dates for packages that were apparently delivered and signed for at the same time? The training and customer care at Purolator is at an all time low. This situation could have been avoided entirely if this customer service representative at Purolator was somewhat receptive to common sense and logic.  I have never seen such blatant disregard for customers or such lazy work ethics in my life.Date of experience: December 03, 2014"

So I cancel all my important plans and wait the entire day expecting my computer. By the way, when they called me they told me that I should expect it anytime between 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. It was half-passed six and still nothing. so I called them and they told me that for residential areas (where I live) the deadline is at 8:00 pm. So I waited till eight, still nothing, I checked the website and it said that it has been delayed but still in transit. So I wait to 10:00 pm and still nothing. I checked the website again and it said the it will be delivered the NEXT day due to missed delivery. So now here I am, it is the next day and still NOTHING!

4468,Taylor Folk,"Unable to follow directions from the startI flew out to Vancouver to perform for Grey Cup on Thursday. My car was in the shop and had 2 shirts I needed. I only realized after the dealer was closed so I formed a plan to overnight ship it for next day delivery. This depended on 2 things: excellent customer service from the dealership to send it, and purolator to send it for the next day , the service I paid 50$ for. Only one came through. It was due to arrive at 1030am Friday. After hearing nothing until 4pm, I called and was informed that it was still in Regina (the origin) due to a weather delay (not their fault). I asked for it to be held in Regina because I told them only to ship it if: it's under 50$ and if it'll arrive same or next day. Why else would I pay for overnight shipping? Now would be a good time to point out that I return to Regina at 8am Monday.  Now, Monday morning, I call for an update and am told that my package arrived in Vancouver on Friday at 317 pm. I would like to point out this was about 30 min before I placed my ""where's my package?"" call. I asked for it to just get dropped off at the westjet desk immediately but no, it has to go all the way to the destination (the hotel I was leaving). In the end I wasted 50$ and now I'm not getting 2 irreplaceable team shirts or a once-in-a-lifetime Worlds Team bag back, all because I trusted purolator, whom I originally thought was a good company, because since it's hard to ""not"" send a package across the country, I do not have enough cash at the moment to get a package I did not want sent returned to me for an extra 40$. 90$ wasted for trusting a shipping company to ship effectively.  In the end I ask these questions: why claim you can modify the shipment when you very obviously can't? If a package is shipped through overnight service with explicit instructions as to ""if"" it should be sent (<50$ and morning the next day) and isn't going to arrive overnight, why would you not inform the customer and seek direction (if the very blunt instructions weren't easy enough)? Why have a computerized tracking system (barcodes) if it's not being used effectively (the answers I received about my shipment made it seem like it was sent off in a canoe into the wild with the courier instructions being delivered by a brain damaged homing pigeon). The customer service representatives were helpful enough but the service itself was terrible. My package arrived in Vancouver 30 minutes before I was told it was in a warehouse in Regina. Instead of sending it out right away, they waited until Monday morning before 1030 to complete the shipment (I refer you once more to the explicit instructions) instead of asking me, the customer, what I would like done. (Aka change the delivery method to a later time). Because even though it did end up landing on Friday they were planning still to deliver it on Monday because it was due for 1030am delivery, not later. If it's already late then why does that distinction matter? I'd rather have my important package the right day instead of the right time. Poor initiative (to get me my package) and poor customer service (to inform and seek instruction).  If you're looking to ship purolator, then after this first time experience I suggest you either don't, or you make sure it's neither time-sensitive or important nor valuable/irreplaceable. The thing that irks me most is the lack of compassion towards clients and disregard for their requests. I don't think getting a free return-ship is too much to ask after my experience but apparently money is more important than a good company image.Date of experience: December 01, 2014"

4471,Hans,"Moronic system forces delays on customersTL;DR: AVOID PUROLATOR! Anything else will be better, even Canada Post!  Like most delivery services, delivery attempts happen during the day when we're at work. It's usually not a problem as the delivery company will leave the package to their closest pick up location which is usually close-by. Enter the world of Purolator. Whenever a delivery is missed, it takes the day for the parcel to go back to the central depot. In our case, it is about 3 hours away (return) by public transport. Nobody living downtown would ever go there, and that's the point of using a delivery service.Only once you've missed the delivery can you request _on a best effort basis for Purolator_ to have your shipment delivered to a closer pick up location. This happened to me today. I had to wait to miss the shipment yesterday to request for it to be held at a closer office. But somehow, requesting this before noon the day before wasn't enough and the depot didn't manage to bring it to the holding office today. And today is Friday, Purolator doesn't work on weekends.If I'm lucky, the shipment will be transferred on Monday and I'll have to pick it up at the end of the business day. That's a completely avoidable 5 days delay right there. Every day that passes without this shipment is a day I can't work. I usually pay extra just to avoid shipping by Purolator but this being an RMA, I didn't get the chance to pick. Even Canada Post (who owns 91% of Purolator) does better for a lot cheaper. Like others said, avoid like the plague!!!Date of experience: September 12, 2014"
4472,John Korchok,"Worst Customer Service AwardMy nomination for worst customer service ever goes to Purolator Courier of Canada. I called them to have a large package picked up in Canada and brought to me in the U.S. I requested Ground Service at $57, because Express was around $400. Before I hung up, I double-checked ""That's going to be Ground service, right?"" and was assured it would be.When the driver went to pick up the package, he did not communicate any of this information. He made the sender fill out the waybill, which does not display an option for Ground Service. Instead it reads ""U.S. Deferred"", which is Purolator secret code for Ground. After the sender checked off Express service by mistake, he didn't correct them.Now Purolator is claiming the waybill has precedence over my phone request, even though they knew it was a mistake. I can't afford $400 for a shipment, so I refused receipt of the package. They are returning it to the sender and are going to try to bill the sender for the return.

4476,Jesse,"One missed call. Package sent back across the country.Purolator was entrusted with a critically important package being sent to my girlfriend from Ontario. This package was 6 weeks worth of short-term disability pay for time taken off work for a surgical procedure that we had already been waiting almost 2 months to receive from RBC Insurance.Apparently, after Purolator tried to drop the package off and couldn't get into our apartment building, they phoned us at 5:20 pm. Unfortunately, that's the usual time my girlfriend would be on the bus coming home from work, so she missed the call. We didn't know anything was going on, and that was the one and only time they ever attempted to make contact. Not even one of those little delivery attempt slips stuck to our front door. NOTHING.The package then sat in the local Purolator depot for a week, that being 7 entire days, from the 11th to the 18th of July. Still no further attempt was made to contact us. On the 18th, they contacted the shipper of the package, RBC Insurance, who had Purolator return it to them.When we started to get worried that the package hadn't shown up by the 18th(We weren't expecting it until the 15th anyways), and finally got the tracking number for the item and looked it up, it was already too late. It was on a trailer heading back to Ontario. (We live in Alberta) I'd like to give a 2 star rating, because the guy I talked to at Purolator was sympathetic and not at fault, and at least explained the situation to me in a manner I found helpful.But as a company, I'd give Purolator a 0/5, if not an arbitrarily large  negative number like -17billion/5. So they get a 1/5, the lowest the site will allow.Date of experience: July 24, 2014"
4477,Shawna Laurent,"Horrible.I am only giving this company a star because I have to.I ordered a very expensive iPhone 5s from Brandon manitoba, to come to me in Burlington, ON, and it was shipped early sunday morning. (July 20th), and I have used a post office on a sunday before so i know they're open. However It was not processed until about 1pm the next day, therefore pushing back the expected delivery date. I was told I was going to recieve an email that would allow me to track my shipment, however the ability to do that was not in the email, nor was i givin a tracking number. I emailed them asking about it and when it was expected to be here now after a delay in process, at about 9 am on monday, and they did not get back to me until 4pm the same day. They They only answered the expected shipping date and not my question about why I couldn't track it, all they said was that I would recieve an email layer that night that would allow me to do so, still no email. So I emailed them back the next morning -and I got no answer. Still no answer and it's wednesday, I was told it was supposeed to be HERE by today! I paid a significant amount of money for this phone, and have already sold my old one because I was expecting this one by wednesday (like they told me) and i have yet to even recieve a tracking number.

4479,Jake Smith,"Earlier than expected delivery, friendly, communicative and inexpensiveFAST DELIVERYI ordered some clothes from Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch on the 2nd.  My order was processed on the 3rd. Considering the 4th was a national holiday in the United States (i.e. Independence Day) and the 5th and 6th were the weekend. I was able to receive my packages on the 8th despite the expectation that they would be delivered 5 to 7 days after my order which would be the 9th to 11th. So, their delivery was quick and faster than expected. INEXPENSIVEThe cost for shipping was only $15 which is much cheaper than other shipping companies, and especially cheap to transport from California to Ontario. COMMUNICATIVEI was given a tracking number for my package and every step of the way I was able to see where my shipment was and what the action being taken was at each time period. You need to pay more for this tracking feature with some shipping companies such as Canada Post but it came free with the shipping cost from Purolator. FRIENDLYThe delivery man drove right up to my house. I already had heard it from upstairs because the windows were open. He knocked on the door. He addressed me by name.  I signed that I had received it. I thanked him. He provided well wishes. SUMMARY: No problems whatsoever. I was well-informed throughout the entire process all for a very inexpensive cost and delivered well in advance of the expectant date. Will use Purolator again in the future -- and it seems that companies are only offering this choice (I can see why -- because they're great.)Date of experience: July 08, 2014"

I called them, they said they would have the delivery guy turn around and come back. Of course no one showed up. The following day I checked to see if they were gonna deliver it, they said I needed to pick up within 5 business days.

4481,Matt,"First impressions count the most, and I am far from impressedI am a first time user of purolator, and not by choice. The company I ordered from only uses purolator for it's US to Canada shipments. I am not impressed at all with there service. This morning on the expected/guaranteed date of delivery, I checked the tracking number to see that it was indeed delivered. Yet when I checked outside my house there was no package anywhere in sight. So I proceeded to check the additional details of the shipment only to find out it was delivered to a completely different address about 5 streets away. Not a problem, it's a nice day, I decided to walk and go pick it up myself. Upon arriving and searching up and down the street I realize that the address that it was delivered to did not even exist!!! So I call the purolator hotline like any normal person would do when there is a problem that needs inquiry. Instead of raining an ungodly firestorm of hell upon them, which believe me I wanted to, remaining calm seemed like the better option. Lo and behold, I am treated with no respect by there customer service and my issue ""isn't high priority"" according to the person whose name escaped my mind faster than a pig rolls around in s**t.

If anyone wants to lose business use this courier company.  Both the agent and the manager were obviously annoyed that i would ask them to help me by contacting the drive to leave the package near me.  They both claimed they couldn't do that when i know they can.   In fact they did it for me last week because I'm staying in an apartment in Vancouver and my primary residence is Ontario.  There is no telephone here.  I did call them last week to inform of the situation and asked them to leave it with superintendent of building who had agreed to sign for it.

4489,abbacus52,"Absolute trash, avoid like the plague.I had the misfortune of having a few  parcels mailed to me at once (computer gear) via Purolater as it was the only shipping option available.  Their tracking system is inaccurate, slow and belongs in the 90's. The drivers are lazy and won't attempt deliveries of heavier items later in their shifts, if he sees 2x 16lb boxes expect to be going to a depot after 3-4 days of playing grab ass. The nearest depots are usually in some industrial part of town in the middle of nowhere, so have fun with that too. Expect to take multiple days off of work when your tracking information lists it as  ""On truck for Delivery"" only to have him never show up, not leave a door card, etc.  I have been dealing with their garbage for nearly 14 years now at 3 different addresses and it's the same damn game every time. Enjoy your multiple days of 12 hour shifts watching the door like a hawk only for it to update near the end of the day telling you to go pound sand.  Get used to seeing ""Appointment required for delivery.

Wait ALL DAY LONG, and find out that a slip is pasted on my door -- absolutely ZERO effort from the guy to look directly to his/her left to see a doorbell that chimes so loud that I can hear it from any corner of the unit. 2 days ago -- get another call informing me that I need to be present today to pick up an item. I need this item, once again, for work. I wait ALL DAY LONG once again, and this time they don't even show up. I most definitely hate wasting my time complaining and almost NEVER write reviews online, so you can imagine the frustration and annoyance that I'm facing. Sure-fire way to get themselves out of business.

Customer ""service"" 1 (888) 744-7123 are only there to tell you they can NOT do anything; ""parcel is on its way"", ""we can NOT get hold of the driver"" they say.

PUROLATOR  drivers, always rushing, usually says your name is NOT on the building board (I happen to live in the building for the past 3 years) ; Canada Post always find me !3. Is there any REGULATION on this jungle business ? Or ""self-regulation"" is the only law of the land in Ontario ?4. Asked for case to be escalated.

4498,Julian Van B,"A cancer on the shipping industryTo put this entire company mildly, Purolator is a cancer. Just like [External reference] and [External reference], they care not for customer satisfaction, but only for the quickest dime they can make. They constantly cut corners, slow shipping times, and offer the most pitiful service possible all to raise the useless bottom line so that some soulless accountant can jerk himself off at night. Where in God's name do I start with these short bus riding couriers? As well as Trustpilot, I can also see a pleasant 30% average on consumer satisfaction on Yelp and Google, so needless to say that this will be yet another unique interpretation of a classic story. I’ll try to make it simple for the morons at Purolator to understand. Now I can understand that a package might not be here before Christmas – it’s a busy season. I just wished the mouth breather who lumbered towards my front door with my GTX 760 understood how to ring a door bell (protip- you just push a button). And thus, even when I waited all day for my new graphics card to come, the only decency I could be rewarded was a slip telling me to pick it up in 3 days because Purolator can’t be bothered to run a business on weekends in the year 2013. I guess I’ll just have to go pick it up myself because god forbid, this soulless corporation should do ANYTHING for the consumer. That is of course if I go to the right one, because while on the slip it told me to go to the Purolator in Fairview, a message on my phone told me to go to the Purolator in the ass end of Richmond, right next to the airport. I’d be surprised at this point of they didn't drop my new hardware in a puddle because they were distracted by a distant butterfly. Even with all my angry, frustrated, ranting, the reason why Purolator has such an astonishing lack of respect for its clientele is 100% crystal clear. They, along with [External reference] and [External reference] have nearly monopolized the industry. They know they can just screw with us because they’re the only game in town next to [External reference] and the [External reference], and I wished Newegg just used them instead. Purolator, to put your conduct simply, I trust chimpanzees to be better couriers than you.

4499,Bedros Balabanian,"Worst delivery company ever - NEVER AGAIN!!!!Purolator has got to be the worst delivery company. Absolutely worthless with rude clerks and lazy drivers! I purchased tires and had them delivered to me by Purolator. On the day of the arrival, I noticed from the window of my house that the Purolator truck came and so I waited at the window to see if the driver would need my help. So I'm standing there at the window, IN FULL VIEW of the driver who comes out of the truck, SEES ME THERE AT THE WINDOW, and then goes ahead and puts something in the mail box at the edge of the driveway. He then goes ahead and gets back in the truck and starts driving away!!!! Flabbergasted, I open the door, without a coat on (snow around us is about 2 meters high in Montreal) and start running after the truck, to wave the driver down and in the process fall down on the ice, break my eye glasses, my wallet flies out of my pocket. So I pick myself up, I head to the mail box and inside the lazy driver has put a delivery notice saying that I wasn't home!!!! I do a tracking on the web and the results say that I wasn't home!!!! So I take the delivery notice, and go to the Purolator office to pick up my tires, for which I PAID EXTRA for door to door delivery. I'm at the Purolator office and they ask me for an ID and that's when I realize that when I fell down, the transparent nylon pocket that holds my drivers license and medicare card is not there, it had fallen out of my wallet when my wallet flew out of my pocket when I fell. Meanwhile this is the day of the big storm in Montreal and I had driven to the Purolator office under treacherous conditions. So the clerk refuses to release the goods to me unless I show a government ID with my photo. I show her my Social security card with my name on it and all my credit cards with my name on them and my costco card which has my picture on it, but she's not budging so I get extremely angry and we have an argument. Bottom line is that she won't release my goods unless I show her a Government issues Photo ID. So I drive back home, grab my Canadian Permanent resident card which has a photo of me and is government issued and drive back to Purolator office. This time they won't release the goods because the Canadian Permanent resident card has no address on it but in my presence they just gave merchandise to another person who came to pick up and he showed them his Medicare card WHICH DOES NOT HAVE AN ADDRESS ON IT!!!!!! So now the manager gets called because the matter is escalating beyond reason, and after making my case with the manager why I don't have another ID for 40 minutes, they finally give me my goods. The driver who caused all this mess did not even ring my door bell to check if I was at home, even if he didn't see me at the window - which is impossible not to because my windows are large and I had all the lights on and I was standing there waiting for him!!!! I will never buy from a company again who uses Purolator to ship their goods, I will never use Purolator for any of my shipping needs.

I went to pick it up a few days later and when I got there they said that the package had been damaged and was sent to another location on the other side of the city. They had not called me at all to tell me this so I walked there (20 min) for nothing. The lady there gave me the number of the location so I could call and I did. They told me some of the jars had been damaged (even though they were all bubble wrapped and than wrapped in towels, stored nicely in there by my father and taped up very well).  They said that they would repack what was left and send it to the original location it was to be sent to. I picked it up and carried it home, opened it and a face cloth and the bottle of maple syrup are missing, plus they led me to believe that a couple of the jars maybe two or three got damaged but five of the jars are gone and the original tote it came in.  For the original tote to be damaged and the amount of stuff that got broken in there after my fathers careful packaging, the package had to be mishandled.

4501,Jumping Jack,"Not lost a parcel yetIf I see that a company uses Purolator to ship I usually cancel the order unless it's the only game in town (like Newegg.ca (grumble)). Canada Post all the way! Their lowest cost service isn't quite as fast as Purolator but I can be guaranteed that I get my parcels on the first delivery attempt (much higher levels of professionalism from their staff--the benefit of a unionized workforce!), and, if not on the first attempt, at least they're available for pickup the same evening at a location that's only a 10 minutes walk from my house. Purolator is an OK company in terms of getting a package from point A to point B INSIDE their own network (if the tracking info is to be believed). But, in my part of Toronto (postal code M4J 1C4) they're downright awful in terms of getting packages to me AT HOME.  My wife and I work a full time job which means we're not home during working hours (and, even when my wife was off on mat leave they STILL managed to never deliver ANY package on the first attempt even though she was home during the day). The only time Purolator ever tries to deliver is during ""normal"" working hours so I have NEVER received a shipment from them on the first try. Usually it takes them two or three attempts to get it right or I just give up and have them redirect to my work address. Now I send the parcel straight to my work address if I know I'm dealing with Purolator because I'd rather not have to deal with their friendly, but highly ineffective customer service department. Plus, Purolator's depot in this part of the city is out in the middle of nowhere (a 35 minute walk one way along a pretty grungy road populated by lots of drivers hell bent on killing anyone who's not in a car) so EXTREMELY inconvenient and also a slight bit dangerous. You'd think that repeated attempts to deliver a package would cost them money because I make them deliver rather than waste an hour and a half out of my day trekking to the lake and back. Ah well, I guess this is what the federal government wants Canada Post to devolve into--a private company offering terrible service, even to people in high density parts of the country where providing high quality service costs a fraction to deliver compared to small, low density towns. Mind you, my service experience with Purolator sounds a lot better than what people in small town Canada experience (which is why I'm prepared to give them three stars).Date of experience: December 18, 2013"

I was told it would come Tuesday but it didn't and they said there was a delay and that I would receive it Wednesday. It didn't arrive, and showed that it was in LONDON so I called and asked about that and they said I would receive it Thursday because there was a shipping error and it was sent to the wrong city. I talked to a 'tracking specialist' who promised I would receive my package Thursday morning and now it's back in Toronto getting sorted (why would he tell my that I would have it this morning if it needed to go back to TO to get sorted!?), and I'm still waiting for a call back. Between all this I spoke to a woman who was basically blaming me for having it redirected and then a different guy was telling me that this sort of thing happens (well, I've never had a single problem with any other courier).

I used to love purolator because they shipped pretty fast and they do ring the doorbell more than once but unfornately, I had so many delays in my trackings during this week. They've been delayed 2-4 days due to missed connections and missed delivery (they didn't deliver to my house so don't get confused, they didn't have enough time to delivery to me!).

4509,Katherine,"Allowed some random to refuse my packageOn Thursday the 28th I got a parcel slip on my door saying that after 4:30 my package would be available for pickup. I wasn't able to go that day or Friday so on Monday I made my way over to get my package. When I got there I gave the employee the slip that was left on my door and she went into the back. After several moments she came back and said that for some reason she couldn't find it in the back, but not to worry, she would track it down on the computer. So she goes on the computer and she seems quite confused. Then she looks at the ticket, back up at me, and to the computer screen. ""Was the package from Starbucks?"" she asked.  I told her that, yes, the parcel was coming from Starbucks. It turns out that three hours before hand someone else had come in with a slip from my package and since their name wasn't on it and they couldn't pick it up they decided to refuse it.  I questioned how someone who wasn't me could refuse my package, especially considering that I need ID to pick the damn package up that has my name and address (which I am not against, but the rules should be the same for refusing a package). The lady swore up and down that the shipping address was this other woman's address and her phone number was even the one on file! I call bull to that. No other women live at my address, I'm the one who filled out the shipping information (and what are the chances of me putting down some random persons address and phone number?), I had already received the bill at MY address, and lastly if it weren't filled out for MY address then why did I still get a parcel slip to my address in the first place? It doesn't add up. I'm assuming that the employee who accepted the refusal didn't even check to see if this person lived at the address in question and just let them turn it away. This is completely unacceptable. At the VERY LEAST a call should have been made to me to see what was going on. Why did this person get a slip to my package to begin with? The only other people that live with me are my husband and infant son. Obviously neither of them were this mystery woman. They refused to give me any information on how this mistake occurred and told me the only thing I could do was call the customer service hotline and try to get them to catch the package and reroute it back to my city. I tried calling the number two days in a row when I was available.  They claim to be open until 8 p.m but both times I've gotten a message saying they're closed and then it states their hours. Now I've had to file an online request for it but apparently it takes up to 48 hours for them to respond and by that point it could already be back to the company I bought it from and then I have to sort it out with THEM and pay shipping AGAIN.Date of experience: December 04, 2013"

4533,Matt Inglis,"Absolute GarbageI recently moved from Alberta to B.C, and didn't have room for all my possesions, so I had a freind send a few of them via Greyhound for my convience. Greyhound took roughly a week, and I struggled to find time to go to the depot and pick up my packages, but I eventually got them all, safe and sound with no hassle on the companies end. When I was ready for my next round of possesion to come, my freind back home suggested delivery via Purolator for a faster shipment, and delivery right to my door.  1 package of roughly the same size and weight as the 4 i sent by Greyhound cost MORE than the four I had previously shipped, and still took 3 days. When I didn't recieve my delievery after that, I tracked the shipment, and found out ""an adress correction was needed""  Purolator contacted me, using a blocked number, I might add. (Poor choice, as I don't usually answer those) and asked for my apartment's buzzer number. After I got it for them, I called the 1-800 number I was provided with, and spoke to a rude, abrupt woman who was of no help. When asked if would be home for delievery tomorrow, I replied, only before 10 A.M as I work Monday-Friday. I then asked if I could pick the package up, and was told I would need I.D with my current adress on it. Having only moved two weeks ago, I don't have updated ID. I was told pick-up would be impossible without it. I was also told delivery couldn't be made to my adress before 10 A.M, pretty much telling me I couldn't recieve my package anytime soon.  When I asked if package could be returned to sender so they could re-send it using a different comany, the phone representative suggested I have the package deleivered to my work. After an excrutating three minutes trying to explain I work at a television studio called C-T-V, not I-S-T-C-V, the representative told me to make sure if someone was going to recive the package other than myself, (receptionist, etc) that I warn them, so the package isn't turned away. In closing, Purolator would not let me pick up my own belongings, that I paid outragous prices to ship, they could not deliver, BUT, however, they would just simply drop it off with a receptionist at an office downtown, no questions asked? Where is the logic behind that?  I will never be using this service again, and will be informing my social groups of the difficulties I encountered while trying to use Purolator, and reccomending the use of competators.Date of experience: January 14, 2013"
4534,Johan Boer,"Unacceptable delivery policy and no client considerationI sometimes order items online for the convenience to have it delivered to my door. Typically couriers will phone and agree on an approximate delivery time that someone will be home, or leave a note to call them.  Unfortunately purolator's service ethics is not in line with industry standards. They came in the middle of the day (when normal harworking Canadians are at work) to my door, found no-one at home, and left a note that I can pick up the package from their warehouse, more than a 50km return trip from my home. When I complained to purolator about this system, their response was defensive and blaming my trip on my inability to read their note. They claimed that they would have phoned me the next day to agree on a delivery time, and that this is indicated as such on their note. I re-examined the note, and still can't find it, not even in the fine script on the back of the note. It only indicates that I can pick up the package and that they will hold the package for 5 business days.  To me there are 2 principles wrong in the way Purolator treats the clients of other companies that use Purolator to deliver their products: •They can make a quick call like other couriers to find out approximately what time you are home, which they refuse to do. •They place the blame for their ineffective operations on the shoulder of the client.  To be honest, next round it will be more convenient for me to drive 5 km to my local store and buy the product in person. If I pay for the convenience for delivery, I don't need to drive 50km to collect the part myself, after paying double the cost. If I need to order another item next time, and the dealer uses the services of Purolator, I will unfortunately cancel the order.Date of experience: January 10, 2013"

4544,Steve,"Unreliable and idiotic.I checked the web site regarding a package one recent morning, and saw that it was ""on vehicle for delivery"".  I took steps to ensure that someone would be home for the entire day, yet no delivery.  Furthermore, I saw a Purolator truck drive by. I live on a quiet residential road.  It is not a through route, so I assumed he was delivering something to a neighbour and would be back shortly, but he never returned.  Later that night, I checked and found that the tracking was updated to indicate that a scheduled delivery appointment was required - and that this change was made about 5 minutes after I saw the truck drive by.   Early next morning, I called and was told that the package was once again on the truck for delivery and would arrive by the end of the day, but once again, no delivery and the web site was once again updated to say that an appointment was required.   The next time I called, I was advised that the double failed delivery indicated an incorrect address.  I had a receipt from the vendor and knew that the address shipped to was correct.  It had allowed the post office, UPS, Fed Ex, and the pizza guy to all find my house with no problems, but apparently not Purolator. That evening, I was speaking to a neighbour of mine, and she told me that for two consecutive days, she had a number on her call display.  She called it and found it was Purolator - they had called my 2nd floor neighbour twice (without leaving a message).  Apparently, because my neighbour did not answer (she was at work), they assumed that the address on the package was incorrect. Finally, on the third day, the driver delivered it (and the address was perfect.) It even turned out that the delivery was ""no signature required"" in the first place - he could have avoided this bad review, avoided my rage and given acceptable service if he had just dropped the package on the front porch and driven away on that first day.  It must have taken more effort to load the package 3 times than it would have actually taken to deliver it.

My buzzer is conected to my cell phone so not only do I always hear when someone is buzzing, I know when I have missed a buzz because my phone has a missed call. Three times I have been home, three times I have not been buzzed at all, no followup, three times the ""attempted delivery"" has failed. I did not even receive a notice of attempted delivery which makes me believe the driver didnt even show up in the first place. I even called customer service to reiterate my address, buzz code, and contact number but not even that worked. Now I need to drive an HOUR out to the nearest depot just to pickup the package I PAID them to deliver. Complete incompetence. DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY!Date of experience: July 25, 2012"
4546,Emmanuel Goldstein,"Beyond worthless.Actually -999.999.999/0. So I need something shipped next day and UPS is around $50. I call Purolator and the guy says ""$25-30"". Great. I get there the next day and he says $40. Fine, still cheaper. He tells me it will be there the next day at 10:30am. That was Thursday...I'm writing this Monday afternoon and it just arrived. Is Monday the ""next day"" after Thursday? Maybe Purolator needs to hire Rebecca Black as a consultant. I could have sent it via Canada Post for $24 and had it there by Monday. I could have paid UPS the $50 and had it there the actual next day. And their excuse when I called and spoke to two useless customer ""service"" people for 40 minutes trying to get a partial refund? ""It was held up in Customs"". Well, Customs didn't take my money. Customs didn't tell me it would arrive the next day. But hey, who knew an international shipping company would have to deal with Customs? That's crazy talk! If I'm 3 hours late for work I don't tell my boss, ""you still have to pay me cuz it's not my fault there was traffic"". He'd laugh me out of his office. If they at least said anything like ""oh, it may be delayed due to blah blah"" then I'd be 100% fine about it. They REFUSE to take any responsibilty. The twit I got ""escalated"" to told me ""dur, it's in the 22 page agreement on our website so STFU"". I didn't use the website. It may as well be on the Great Wall of China. It's not even on the 10 paragraphs of fine print on my receipt. If the website said ""we'll throw your package in the trash and use your money for cocaine and hookers"" that wouldn't make it acceptable.

However Purolator is the ONLY courier I have used where my package arrived at 11 am. UPS and FedEX both have delivered after 4pm, a more reasonable time for almost anyone with a job or school. But that is just the beginning, I left specific intructions with the place I ordered my package from and Purolator outright IGNORED my request and now it is sitting in a depot since noon and Purolator REFUSES to ship again today, even though there would be plenty of time to do so to rectify their mistake. I left instructions to leave the package with the landlord of my complex if I do not answer my door when they show up, FedEX followed my request when I was not in town and a overseas shipping company IN KOREA RELAYED THIS MESSAGE when I ordered a monitor FROM KOREA.

4556,amy,"Purolator is a joke!Purolator is a huge joke. I have had to use this shipper several times and each and every time it turns into a huge inconvenience.  First off their shipment tracking online or by phone sucks. All it ever says is picked up by purolator. No information updates ever making it difficult to arrange for me to be home for delivery which brings me to my second issue.  When the  info did update it was wrong. Several times I have left work or missed it to be at home to meet my package and of course. No delivery. I phoned there today and when finally was able to speak to someone he was a huge dink. Customer service gets 0 stars as far as I'm concerned. People at depot not much friendlier. My third and final issue is this. We live about an hour and a half from a city. I have had more than once only one delivery attempt if I happened to not be home for delivery. There has never ever been a second attempt made. This makes this interesting when working shift work and having to arrange a 3 hour round trip drive into e city because they won't try a second attempt.

4559,Pistol Pete,"I wish I could give less than one starPurolator is THE worst ""delivery"" company out there. I hesitate to use the word delivery, because they are essentially an inter-warehouse shipping company, and so are about as convenient as using VIA rail to get a parcel to my doorstep. They make ONE attempt at delivery (compared to 3 for FedEx and UPS) and in many or most cases the date of delivery is unpredictable. What is the chance the average joe with a job is going to be home at 1:30pm on a random weekday? Your packege then it goes to the warehouse, which is typically out of the way. Compare this to USPS/Canada Post, with post offices in almost every neighbourhood. So I call in a favour to get a lift to the warehouse and find the time between work-- and am confronted with a 15-person lineup and only one employee. Seeing as purolator doesn't actually make many deliveries, you would think they could amp up their warehouse staffing. 45 minutes later I get my package. Next time, postal service will be the first choice, then UPS/FedEx/DHL/any other company.  I""d rather not ship then go with Purolator.Date of experience: January 19, 2012"
4560,terry,"Terrible!!!AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!( If you can!) I didn’t choose this company. I live in a small building containing 10 units. It is very easy, at the front door, you have the list of the units in numerical order and the name of the occupant, for example: 1-John Smith, 2-Robert  Johnson,… Beside each name/number, there is a buzzer.Very simple, easy and convenient for visitors or for delivery companies, I had lots of packages delivered for the 10 years I’ve been at that address and never a problem.   I had electronics supposed to be delivered to me by Purolator today, on Friday the 30th of December.I had a tracking number, when I checked it online on the 29th, it said : 2011/12/29	14:41	Shipment In Transit	2011/12/29	14:40	Picked up by Purolator	I called them and they told me it would be for sure delivered on the next day.So I checked the next day (today then) at around 11:30 and it said : 2011/12/30	11:10	On vehicle for delivery	2011/12/30	03:24	Shipment In Transit	   I was excited, according to that I expected to receive the parcel in the next hour or so. I had to leave home but my wife could stay and wait for the buzzer. When I came back at 3pm, I was surprised , there was no parcel at home, my wife had not gotten any buzz or news. There wasn’t any notice on the front door either. Unfortunately , at that time we started to have a power outage in the neighbourhood, so I couldn’t check the online tracking system. I called Purolator, asking them to tell the driver that the buzzer wouldn’t work and that he should call my phone instead but I was told that drivers don’t carry cell phones (?!?)Also they couldn’t check my status because my name was not enough, they needed my tracking number, which I could not access because I had no power… So I couldn’t put a note on the front door either, therefore I waited more than hours downstairs for the driver’s  arrival . He never came. When the power was restored, I checked the tracking system, and it said : 2011/12/30	14:08	Scheduled Delivery Appointment Required Not sure about what it meant, I called Purolator and I was told that the driver chose not to deliver the item because he didn’t see a code on his papers for the buzzer! Of course, there is no code, I cannot invent one, it is much easier the way it is than with a buzzer, a 5 years old kid can figure it out! He had my name , address and apartment number, that is all he needed. But he decided not to buzz!!!He just went back to his truck and left!!!  When you call Purolator, they have a message playing, pretending that they can deliver on Saturdays. Of course, I asked for that service and they could offer it only if I paid 25 more dollars. I refused and asked to talk to a manager to try and get it for free. What kind of a tactic is that to not deliver an item on a Friday when it should be so that they can get 25 dollars more for delivering it the next day???Anyway,  as angry as I was,I talked to a manager (Darryl Redmond in Moncton), got the name of the route of the driver (7W2) but I couldn’t get to have the parcel delivered on the next day without paying. I refused to pay, so the package will be delivered 5 days later, on Tuesday the 3rd of January, as they don’t work on the 2nd of January. We are very upset. What guarantee do we have that the next driver is going to be more professional than the one we had today? Tuesday’s delivery is if everything goes very well I guess, but it could go on forever if Purolator does not improve its overall system , the communication with its drivers and its training/recruiting of the drivers… Next day update : How do regular customers manage do stay patient or polite with Purolator employees? I just phoned Purolator because I thought it would be better to simply go to the warehouse to get the package since your drivers are so incompetent ( for reminder, the driver supposed to deliver the package decided not to do it because he wanted a code to enter a small building when all he needed was to push the button next to my name as in any regular house).Of course, I was told that it was not possible , but also that the item woul'nt be delivered before Wednesday!!! Now I think your employees are just playing with customers, and exercice revenge with those like me who dare complaining...So childish and unprofessional, shame on your company!!!Of course, nothing I can do but I'll be so careful to spread anyone not to ever take their business to Purolator!!!Date of experience: December 31, 2011"

4562,Will,"Vancouver Downtown LocationI am very disappointed with the level of service with this company. I recently ordered some replacement ink for my printer from HP. The package arrived when I was home but I could not go out immediately. I ran out as fast as I could to meet the Purolator delivery person, by the time I got out here was gone! it wasn't event a minute. So I get a call from him later on in the day but I could not take the call immediately. I call him back a few hours later and no one picks up! I try calling again the next couple of days and to my surprise no response! So a week later, I go the the pick up center in downtown Vancouver to see if I could pickup my package! I didn't have my tracking number but I gave them my last name and some other info, they told me there was no such package with my name! I asked them if they could pass me a number to whom I could contact to get the tracking number, BUT as incompetent as the customer service representatives there, they didn't have a number to give me. Instead of going to Purolator for help, I went to Hp. I then found the tracking number and I called Purolator to see if I could pick up the package today. After I called them they told me that the package has been sent back to HP because they only hold packages for 5 days. Excuse my language but ...WTF, at no time was I given indication of that.  I needed that ink as I will be doing a lot of printing this semester. Now I will have to tell HP to send the package again and this fiasco will probably happen all over again! I an very disapointed to say the least! This could of all been avoided if the person with the package waited an extra 30 seconds. Some potential improvements for Purolator:- The delivery person should wait a little longer and if the receiver is not there they should post a message with pickup information with certain deadlines!- provide tracking and pickup information at the door for those who cannot pickup their package immediately. (inform them that their package will be shipped back to the sender in 5 business days if the package is not picked up!)- customer service should spend a little more time explaining things to people. they lack poise in this area and it shows for people that don't use their services often. Purolator, you should fire your operations consultants, seeking as they are not able to mitigate these issues!Date of experience: June 29, 2011"

I onlyreceived an automated call requiring me to pick up my parcel from awarehouse. Ultimately, instead of spending my time off work by assisting my wife with a few-days-old baby, I had to drive around town and collect my parcel from the Purolator warehouse. Purolator has consistently not delivered the parcels to my home, instead,telling me to pick the parcels from their warehouse. This happnens everysingle time I expect a message from Purolator. The delivery persons ignore the notes I left on the file inregards to the phone numbers to call and other delivery instructions.Purolator's understanding of delivery is to collect the money for thedelivery service and then simply make the goods available for pick up at a remote location.

They then send the package to the warehouse for pickup, even though someone was home when they ""came to the door""; this is another way of them saying, my shift is done for the day, i'm not going to bother with the rest of the packages. By the way, purolator's bourndaries for Depots are very messed up. I have to drive 20-25 minutes north for pickup, when there is a purolator 5 minutes south of me. BUT, what is worse, the homes that are north of me go to the depot south of me, when they should be going north and i should be going south. No sense in this company.

All the driver had to do was give a ring to ask for the buzz code, but no. They actually didn’t even attempt the delivery, because the main door was open all day that day because of some maintenance and it didn’t even need a buzz code. When I checked with the customer care agent, they updated the buzz code and said it would take 3 business days for it to be updated. Also, i was told their drivers don’t have phone.

All the driver had to do was give a ring to ask for the buzz code, but no. They actually didn’t even attempt the delivery, because the main door was open all day that day because of some maintenance and it didn’t even need a buzz code. When I checked with the customer care agent, they updated the buzz code and said it would take 3 business days for it to be updated. Also, i was told their drivers don’t have phone.

All the driver had to do was give a ring to ask for the buzz code, but no. They actually didn’t even attempt the delivery, because the main door was open all day that day because of some maintenance and it didn’t even need a buzz code. When I checked with the customer care agent, they updated the buzz code and said it would take 3 business days for it to be updated. Also, i was told their drivers don’t have phone.

4759,Maqsood Syed,"Pathetic service. Never againThe package was returned and the reason stated was “No buzz code”. They probably don’t know that something as simple as a phone call works. All the driver had to do was give a ring to ask for the buzz code, but no. They actually didn’t even attempt the delivery, because the main door was open all day that day because of some maintenance and it didn’t even need a buzz code. When I checked with the customer care agent, they updated the buzz code and said it would take 3 business days for it to be updated. Also, i was told their drivers don’t have phone. And they expected me to believe it. Just Purolator things. Never ever use their services again.Date of experience: June 28, 2023"

4764,Joseph,"WORST COURIER SERVICE EVERAll my experiences with this courier service has been nothing but terrible..From fake delivery attempt to bad customer service.. They will never call or message you to notify you that they will be coming to deliver your package, then you will get a meaage to come over to their office for pickup (For God sake I paid for delivery).. One of their drivers once told me once that they don't make any delivery attempt once you get a message of failed delivery attempts.. This company shouldn't be in business..Date of experience: June 06, 2023"
4765,D D,"Way to go Purolator!Ran into the Purolator driver today and he helped me out with a no signature sticker for my deliveries. That was really cool of him as he mentioned he hated leaving the stickers on my door. I appreciated what he had to say and made things positive for me today. Again I still think Purolator needs to change their policy on signatures all the time for deliveries and do not hold the driver responsible for that. Never did as I know it comes from the top. Anyway,Thanks to the driver on making my experience positive today.Date of experience: June 19, 2023"

I have a fairly long driveway which I would like to say. Every other shipping company is able to navigate however purelator finds it better to leave my parcels in the dirt on the side of the road nowhere. Near my property. When I said I would like to actually receive my parcels so could they hold them at the access point? They then give me no notification of the parcel being held and if I do not pick it up within 5 days they send it back have never had. A good experience to this day my parcels are either lost stolen or left in the dirt.Date of experience: June 19, 2023"

4769,Benjamin Wright,"Absolutely horrific serviceAbsolutely horrific service, they promise to deliver on a date, they don't deliver on a date, they blame you, then tell you to be home, take the day off, its coming that day, it doesnt come that day, this process repeats, and nobody cares about the time you are wasting of your clients. Nobody calls, nobody cares, and the product still isnt delivered, at this time, I have wasted 3 full days at home on days I was told it was coming, and nobody seem to give a crap. How is Purolator still in business with this level of service.Date of experience: June 19, 2023"
4770,Gordon,"ABYSMALPurolator has consistently failed to deliver on time. Complaints fall on deaf ears. Offer and charge for express service (early AM delivery) to areas that THEY DON'T DELIVER TO, only to hand off to a local carrier without daily service. Latest issue - Early AM delivery from Mississauga to Toronto. End of the day, and it's not delivered. Tracking is useless. Virtual assistant is worse. Phone call isn't answered. Requested a call back which hasn't happened. This is the last straw. I will not pay the invoice, and I've instructed my staff to use ANY courier but Purolator in the future.Date of experience: June 15, 2023"
4771,Carlos Carvalho,"Puro-late packets, always delayed, always missed, no deliver around the time they update the status.I am tired of getting packets delivered by this company, getting a message on their web site saying ""missed delivered"" when there was NO delivery attempt.

I don't recommend.Date of experience: July 05, 2023"
4772,NA,"I just want to give negative starI am extremely dissatisfied with the services provided by this company and would rate them poorly. The behavior of their drivers is consistently rude, often leaving as soon as they hear someone approaching the door. It seems they have no interest in fulfilling their duty to deliver packages and have even suggested that I retrieve my own items from their truck. Such a lack of commitment is unacceptable for a delivery service. I strongly advise against using this company's services. It is disheartening that a significant portion, 90%, of this company is owned by Canada Post. This reflects poorly on Canada as a whole. It would be in everyone's best interest to reconsider its operations and not waste taxpayers' hard-earned money. The quality of service provided is far below what Canadians deserve.Date of experience: May 01, 2023"
