Now, it's only $1, but since I was planning to mail about 20-30 (I sell them) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost, around $1 per book for a total of $20-$30. On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I'd like a picture of the price scale to take home. I'm sorry but that's why I came to the store 4 times!!!

I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside. These cards are extremely meaningful, because her father recently passed away. They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived. If it has a tracking number, they should be able to locate it, right? No not yet and there is no one accountable! What was the point of paying more? They need to change their system, perhaps investigate how Purolator, UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery dates. It's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it's competitors. It's a sad day when you can't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hands of our Canadian Postal Service. The federal gov't needs to investigate what is lacking in this service. I'm guessing not enough employees, outdated technology. I had an MP tell me, sometimes things get lost but he is sorry for my issue? I'm sorry too because that's an UNACCEPTABLE answer.

I live in an apartment so the notice of attempted delivery is always left on my door or in my mailbox. There was no notice of delivery left re: this package. When I went to my local Canada Post, they said that they did not receive it there, that it was at another location - not even in my area. I don't have a car (hence, why I ordered online to begin with). I called the location where they are holding my package and asked why a attempted delivery notice was not left at my home and the girl on the phone said, \"Sometimes, they forget to leave a notice.\" So, how would I know my package was there in the first place if they didn't leave a notice? I thanked her for her superb customer service (there was nothing she could do). I hung up and called the Canada Post Support phone line and told the rep my situation. He said that the package would not be re-attempted to be delivered, although they could check if package could be delivered to my local post office (it could not be). He offered to give me the notice of attempted delivery # because without it, I could not go pick up the package. That's pretty convenient when they \"sometimes forget\" to leave the notice.

I have two witnesses, the secretaries at my office, both stating he did not deliver the package but Canada Post says because he scanned it, it was delivered.

Defund Canada Post. On 3 separate occasions with 3 separate employees I was quoted 1 price for an over sized letter (A small book). On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped books, the teller (who was one of the ones that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier) told me it would be $1 more than what they had said. Now, it's only $1, but since I was planning to mail about 20-30 (I sell them) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost, around $1 per book for a total of $20-$30. On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I'd like a picture of the price scale to take home. I'm sorry but that's why I came to the store 4 times!!! What a waste of time and money.Date of experience: June 05, 2023  \n",

I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside. These cards are extremely meaningful, because her father recently passed away. They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived. If it has a tracking number, they should be able to locate it, right? No not yet and there is no one accountable! What was the point of paying more? They need to change their system, perhaps investigate how Purolator, UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery dates. It's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it's competitors. It's a sad day when you can't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hands of our Canadian Postal Service. The federal gov't needs to investigate what is lacking in this service. I'm guessing not enough employees, outdated technology. I had an MP tell me, sometimes things get lost but he is sorry for my issue? I'm sorry too because that's an UNACCEPTABLE answer. Obviously after reading all of these reviews, something is clearly wrong with this service.Date of experience: May 16, 2023  \n",

       "4798  Notice of Attempted Delivery NOT leftI was waiting for my package and decided to check the tracking number when it did not arrive. I live in an apartment so the notice of attempted delivery is always left on my door or in my mailbox. There was no notice of delivery left re: this package. When I went to my local Canada Post, they said that they did not receive it there, that it was at another location - not even in my area. I don't have a car (hence, why I ordered online to begin with). I called the location where they are holding my package and asked why a attempted delivery notice was not left at my home and the girl on the phone said, \"Sometimes, they forget to leave a notice.\" So, how would I know my package was there in the first place if they didn't leave a notice? I thanked her for her superb customer service (there was nothing she could do). I hung up and called the Canada Post Support phone line and told the rep my situation. He said that the package would not be re-attempted to be delivered, although they could check if package could be delivered to my local post office (it could not be). He offered to give me the notice of attempted delivery # because without it, I could not go pick up the package. That's pretty convenient when they \"sometimes forget\" to leave the notice. The customer service from Canada Post was no help.Date of experience: May 29, 2017  \n",

Apparently they can scan the parcel anytime and anywhere after they leave the post office and then mark it as delivered.  Canada Post then justified this by saying if you had an envelope purchased from them, they could track to exactly where the deliverer was when scanning and otherwise they can and do scan in their vehicle before leaving the post office or anywhere in between.  I have two witnesses, the secretaries at my office, both stating he did not deliver the package but Canada Post says because he scanned it, it was delivered.  I am being left hanging with their resolution of delivered and no responsibility being taken by the postal service for the loss of my $400+ item.  Talk about a lousy, expensive and irresponsible service!!Date of experience: May 29, 2017  \n",

Defund Canada Post . On 3 separate occasion with 3 separate employee I wa quoted 1 price for an over sized letter ( A small book ) . On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped book , the teller ( who wa one of the one that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier ) told me it would be $ 1 more than what they had said . Now , it 's only $ 1 , but since I wa planning to mail about 20-30 ( I sell them ) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost , around $ 1 per book for a total of $ 20- $ 30 . On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I 'd like a picture of the price scale to take home . I 'm sorry but that 's why I came to the store 4 time ! ! ! What a waste of time and money.Date of experience : June 05 , 2023   \n",

MAKE CANADA POST BETTER ! I paid extra for tracking and sent two birthday card to my daughter in AB from ONT , both had gift card in them . I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside . These card are extremely meaningful , because her father recently passed away . They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived . If it ha a tracking number , they should be able to locate it , right ? No not yet and there is no one accountable ! What wa the point of paying more ? They need to change their system , perhaps investigate how Purolator , UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery date . It 's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it 's competitor . It 's a sad day when you ca n't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hand of our Canadian Postal Service . The federal gov't need to investigate what is lacking in this service . I 'm guessing not enough employee , outdated technology . I had an MP tell me , sometimes thing get lost but he is sorry for my issue ? I 'm sorry too because that 's an UNACCEPTABLE answer . Obviously after reading all of these review , something is clearly wrong with this service.Date of experience : May 16 , 2023   \n",

      "4798  Notice of Attempted Delivery NOT leftI wa waiting for my package and decided to check the tracking number when it did not arrive . I live in an apartment so the notice of attempted delivery is always left on my door or in my mailbox . There wa no notice of delivery left re : this package . When I went to my local Canada Post , they said that they did not receive it there , that it wa at another location - not even in my area . I do n't have a car ( hence , why I ordered online to begin with ) . I called the location where they are holding my package and asked why a attempted delivery notice wa not left at my home and the girl on the phone said , `` Sometimes , they forget to leave a notice . '' So , how would I know my package wa there in the first place if they did n't leave a notice ? I thanked her for her superb customer service ( there wa nothing she could do ) . I hung up and called the Canada Post Support phone line and told the rep my situation . He said that the package would not be re-attempted to be delivered , although they could check if package could be delivered to my local post office ( it could not be ) . He offered to give me the notice of attempted delivery # because without it , I could not go pick up the package . That 's pretty convenient when they `` sometimes forget '' to leave the notice . The customer service from Canada Post wa no help.Date of experience : May 29 , 2017   \n",

Apparently they can scan the parcel anytime and anywhere after they leave the post office and then mark it a delivered . Canada Post then justified this by saying if you had an envelope purchased from them , they could track to exactly where the deliverer wa when scanning and otherwise they can and do scan in their vehicle before leaving the post office or anywhere in between . I have two witness , the secretary at my office , both stating he did not deliver the package but Canada Post say because he scanned it , it wa delivered . I am being left hanging with their resolution of delivered and no responsibility being taken by the postal service for the loss of my $ 400+ item . Talk about a lousy , expensive and irresponsible service ! ! Date of experience : May 29 , 2017   \n",

Defund Canada Post . On 3 separate occasion with 3 separate employee I wa quoted 1 price for an over sized letter ( A small book ) . On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped book , the teller ( who wa one of the one that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier ) told me it would be $ 1 more than what they had said . Now , it 's only $ 1 , but since I wa planning to mail about 20-30 ( I sell them ) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost , around $ 1 per book for a total of $ 20- $ 30 . On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I 'd like a picture of the price scale to take home . I 'm sorry but that 's why I came to the store 4 time ! ! ! What a waste of time and money.Date of experience : June 05 , 2023   \n",

MAKE CANADA POST BETTER ! I paid extra for tracking and sent two birthday card to my daughter in AB from ONT , both had gift card in them . I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside . These card are extremely meaningful , because her father recently passed away . They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived . If it ha a tracking number , they should be able to locate it , right ? No not yet and there is no one accountable ! What wa the point of paying more ? They need to change their system , perhaps investigate how Purolator , UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery date . It 's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it 's competitor . It 's a sad day when you ca n't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hand of our Canadian Postal Service . The federal gov't need to investigate what is lacking in this service . I 'm guessing not enough employee , outdated technology . I had an MP tell me , sometimes thing get lost but he is sorry for my issue ? I 'm sorry too because that 's an UNACCEPTABLE answer .

      "4798  Notice of Attempted Delivery NOT leftI wa waiting for my package and decided to check the tracking number when it did not arrive . I live in an apartment so the notice of attempted delivery is always left on my door or in my mailbox . There wa no notice of delivery left re : this package . When I went to my local Canada Post , they said that they did not receive it there , that it wa at another location - not even in my area . I do n't have a car ( hence , why I ordered online to begin with ) . I called the location where they are holding my package and asked why a attempted delivery notice wa not left at my home and the girl on the phone said , `` Sometimes , they forget to leave a notice . '' So , how would I know my package wa there in the first place if they did n't leave a notice ? I thanked her for her superb customer service ( there wa nothing she could do ) . I hung up and called the Canada Post Support phone line and told the rep my situation . He said that the package would not be re-attempted to be delivered , although they could check if package could be delivered to my local post office ( it could not be ) . He offered to give me the notice of attempted delivery # because without it , I could not go pick up the package . That 's pretty convenient when they `` sometimes forget '' to leave the notice . The customer service from Canada Post wa no help.Date of experience : May 29 , 2017   \n",

Apparently they can scan the parcel anytime and anywhere after they leave the post office and then mark it a delivered . Canada Post then justified this by saying if you had an envelope purchased from them , they could track to exactly where the deliverer wa when scanning and otherwise they can and do scan in their vehicle before leaving the post office or anywhere in between . I have two witness , the secretary at my office , both stating he did not deliver the package but Canada Post say because he scanned it , it wa delivered . I am being left hanging with their resolution of delivered and no responsibility being taken by the postal service for the loss of my $ 400+ item . Talk about a lousy , expensive and irresponsible service ! ! Date of experience : May 29 , 2017   \n",

Defund Canada Post . On 3 separate occasion with 3 separate employee I wa quoted 1 price for an over sized letter ( A small book ) . On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped book , the teller ( who wa one of the one that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier ) told me it would be $ 1 more than what they had said . Now , it 's only $ 1 , but since I wa planning to mail about 20-30 ( I sell them ) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost , around $ 1 per book for a total of $ 20- $ 30 . On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I 'd like a picture of the price scale to take home . I 'm sorry but that 's why I came to the store 4 time ! ! !

MAKE CANADA POST BETTER ! I paid extra for tracking and sent two birthday card to my daughter in AB from ONT , both had gift card in them . I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside . These card are extremely meaningful , because her father recently passed away . They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived . If it ha a tracking number , they should be able to locate it , right ? No not yet and there is no one accountable ! What wa the point of paying more ? They need to change their system , perhaps investigate how Purolator , UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery date . It 's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it 's competitor . It 's a sad day when you ca n't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hand of our Canadian Postal Service . The federal gov't need to investigate what is lacking in this service . I 'm guessing not enough employee , outdated technology . I had an MP tell me , sometimes thing get lost but he is sorry for my issue ? I 'm sorry too because that 's an UNACCEPTABLE answer . Obviously after reading all of these review , something is clearly wrong with this service.Date of experience : May 16 , 2023   \n",

      "4798  Notice of Attempted Delivery NOT leftI wa waiting for my package and decided to check the tracking number when it did not arrive . I live in an apartment so the notice of attempted delivery is always left on my door or in my mailbox . There wa no notice of delivery left re : this package . When I went to my local Canada Post , they said that they did not receive it there , that it wa at another location - not even in my area . I do n't have a car ( hence , why I ordered online to begin with ) . I called the location where they are holding my package and asked why a attempted delivery notice wa not left at my home and the girl on the phone said , `` Sometimes , they forget to leave a notice . '' So , how would I know my package wa there in the first place if they did n't leave a notice ? I thanked her for her superb customer service ( there wa nothing she could do ) . I hung up and called the Canada Post Support phone line and told the rep my situation . He said that the package would not be re-attempted to be delivered , although they could check if package could be delivered to my local post office ( it could not be ) . He offered to give me the notice of attempted delivery # because without it , I could not go pick up the package . That 's pretty convenient when they `` sometimes forget '' to leave the notice . The customer service from Canada Post wa no help.Date of experience : May 29 , 2017   \n",

Apparently they can scan the parcel anytime and anywhere after they leave the post office and then mark it a delivered . Canada Post then justified this by saying if you had an envelope purchased from them , they could track to exactly where the deliverer wa when scanning and otherwise they can and do scan in their vehicle before leaving the post office or anywhere in between . I have two witness , the secretary at my office , both stating he did not deliver the package but Canada Post say because he scanned it , it wa delivered . I am being left hanging with their resolution of delivered and no responsibility being taken by the postal service for the loss of my $ 400+ item . Talk about a lousy , expensive and irresponsible service ! ! Date of experience : May 29 , 2017   \n",

Defund Canada Post . On 3 separate occasion with 3 separate employee I wa quoted 1 price for an over sized letter ( A small book ) . On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped book , the teller ( who wa one of the one that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier ) told me it would be $ 1 more than what they had said . Now , it 's only $ 1 , but since I wa planning to mail about 20-30 ( I sell them ) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost , around $ 1 per book for a total of $ 20- $ 30 . On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I 'd like a picture of the price scale to take home . I 'm sorry but that 's why I came to the store 4 time ! ! ! What a waste of time and money.Date of experience : June 05 , 2023   \n",
      "4  FEDERAL GOV'T ... MAKE CANADA POST BETTER ! I paid extra for tracking and sent two birthday card to my daughter in AB from ONT , both had gift card in them . I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside . These card are extremely meaningful , because her father recently passed away . They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived . If it ha a tracking number , they should be able to locate it , right ? No not yet and there is no one accountable ! What wa the point of paying more ? They need to change their system , perhaps investigate how Purolator , UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery date . It 's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it 's competitor . It 's a sad day when you ca n't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hand of our Canadian Postal Service . The federal gov't need to investigate what is lacking in this service . I 'm guessing not enough employee , outdated technology . I had an MP tell me , sometimes thing get lost but he is sorry for my issue ? I 'm sorry too because that 's an UNACCEPTABLE answer . Obviously after reading all of these review , something is clearly wrong with this service.Date of experience : May 16 , 2023   \n",

Defund Canada Post . On 3 separate occasion with 3 separate employee I wa quoted 1 price for an over sized letter ( A small book ) . On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped book , the teller ( who wa one of the one that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier ) told me it would be $ 1 more than what they had said . Now , it 's only $ 1 , but since I wa planning to mail about 20-30 ( I sell them ) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost , around $ 1 per book for a total of $ 20- $ 30 . On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I 'd like a picture of the price scale to take home . I 'm sorry but that 's why I came to the store 4 time ! ! ! What a waste of time and money.Date of experience : June 05 , 2023   \n",
      "4  FEDERAL GOV'T ... MAKE CANADA POST BETTER ! I paid extra for tracking and sent two birthday card to my daughter in AB from ONT , both had gift card in them . I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside . These card are extremely meaningful , because her father recently passed away . They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived . If it ha a tracking number , they should be able to locate it , right ? No not yet and there is no one accountable ! What wa the point of paying more ? They need to change their system , perhaps investigate how Purolator , UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery date . It 's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it 's competitor . It 's a sad day when you ca n't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hand of our Canadian Postal Service . The federal gov't need to investigate what is lacking in this service . I 'm guessing not enough employee , outdated technology . I had an MP tell me , sometimes thing get lost but he is sorry for my issue ? I 'm sorry too because that 's an UNACCEPTABLE answer . Obviously after reading all of these review , something is clearly wrong with this service.Date of experience : May 16 , 2023   \n",

Defund Canada Post . On 3 separate occasion with 3 separate employee I wa quoted 1 price for an over sized letter ( A small book ) . On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped book , the teller ( who wa one of the one that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier ) told me it would be $ 1 more than what they had said . Now , it 's only $ 1 , but since I wa planning to mail about 20-30 ( I sell them ) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost , around $ 1 per book for a total of $ 20- $ 30 . On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I 'd like a picture of the price scale to take home . I 'm sorry but that 's why I came to the store 4 time ! ! ! What a waste of time and money.Date of experience : June 05 , 2023\n",

( An 8 hour trip by car from Langley to Nelson . ) Postal code for BC start with V.Montreal start with H. Needless to say my sister did not receive her much needed good . Parcel value of at least $ 200 they only cover $ 100 . Which I just found out . Parcel outlet in Langley said out of their hand after it leaf there . Then it go to Richmond . Flat rate box wa close to $ 22 . Phoned Canada Post it ’ s under investigation tracked this morning and ha finally been sent back to BC . Today finally out for delivery in Nelson . Ok so don ’ t know if employee in Richmond are actually reading the address or postal code . Very upsetting to say the least and now can no longer trust Canada Post.Date of experience : May 08 , 2023\n",

I paid for signature required - Canada Post delivered to wrong address , accepted a wrong name and signature , then would n't tell me where they did this . I wa not able to recover my parcel . Investigation took almost 2 month just to call me back , and their conclusion wa that now too much time had passed to be able to do anything about it . Incompetence at it finest ! Investigator and Ombudsman were just a bad a the delivery driver . Save yourself the agony and avoid Canada Post at all cost - or it will cost you.Date of experience : April 04 , 2023\n",

Packages routinely take 3 month or more to get to Sudbury On . At first wa quick until mid last year . some item get here early but most take forever and most I pay shipping on . They go on strike every time they can wanting more money but they do n't even do their job properly . They are supposed to deliver package to your door . NOT ONCE ha he done that unless needing signature . I am at home every day a I work from home and think it ridiculous he will take the time to fold my package in half and stuff into box but wont knock on my door for 2 second . He left a really expensive pair of dress shoe just hanging off the hook under my mailbox . Left a violin bow ( 2.5 foot long ) hanging out of mail box . People walk threw my side yard to go threw to back street and mailbox is right there so they can grab a package on way . I have to be vigilant in watching mailman deliver for 2 month in order to make sure I get my stuff . I think I 'm going to start my own postal carrier biz lol.Date of experience : June 20 , 2017\n",

I have had no problem until this . I cost a seller his money and dvd 's and he told me not to buy off of them cause it wa costing him money.Date of experience : June 17 , 2017\n",

Apparently they can scan the parcel anytime and anywhere after they leave the post office and then mark it a delivered . Canada Post then justified this by saying if you had an envelope purchased from them , they could track to exactly where the deliverer wa when scanning and otherwise they can and do scan in their vehicle before leaving the post office or anywhere in between . I have two witness , the secretary at my office , both stating he did not deliver the package but Canada Post say because he scanned it , it wa delivered . I am being left hanging with their resolution of delivered and no responsibility being taken by the postal service for the loss of my $ 400+ item . Talk about a lousy , expensive and irresponsible service ! ! Date of experience : May 29 , 2017\n",

Defund Canada Post . On 3 separate occasion with 3 separate employee I wa quoted 1 price for an over sized letter ( A small book ) . On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped book , the teller ( who wa one of the one that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier ) told me it would be $ 1 more than what they had said . Now , it 's only $ 1 , but since I wa planning to mail about 20-30 ( I sell them ) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost , around $ 1 per book for a total of $ 20- $ 30 . On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I 'd like a picture of the price scale to take home . I 'm sorry but that 's why I came to the store 4 time ! ! !

MAKE CANADA POST BETTER ! I paid extra for tracking and sent two birthday card to my daughter in AB from ONT , both had gift card in them . I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside . These card are extremely meaningful , because her father recently passed away . They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived . If it ha a tracking number , they should be able to locate it , right ? No not yet and there is no one accountable ! What wa the point of paying more ? They need to change their system , perhaps investigate how Purolator , UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery date . It 's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it 's competitor . It 's a sad day when you ca n't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hand of our Canadian Postal Service . The federal gov't need to investigate what is lacking in this service . I 'm guessing not enough employee , outdated technology . I had an MP tell me , sometimes thing get lost but he is sorry for my issue ? I 'm sorry too because that 's an UNACCEPTABLE answer . Obviously after reading all of these review , something is clearly wrong with this service.Date of experience : May 16 , 2023\n",

      "6       POOR SERVICES , POLICIES NOT IN PUBLIC INTEREST BUT FOR PROFIT.one of my parcel wa coming all the way from India to canada . i had paid $ 120 to get it here in canada . I live on rent in basement and my landlord 's guest attended the delivery man , he ha denied to recognize a it wa for tenant . but the delivery man did not even try to call me to confirm about the address issue or whatsoever they had thought . nor even any of canada post employee tried to contact me about the delivery failure , no text , no call to inform me that they planned to send back back my parcel to overseas ( India ) so quick just in 2 day gap . I used to track the parcel after every 2 day . and when i tracked that day- it showed me unsuccessful delivery . on that i called canada post that i will pick that up by own from the location a it wa near . but they keep on denying that they will only send it back to sender . & excusing that might delivery man did not have your contact info . but whyyyyy ? if i had given my contact detail , that wa for whatttt ? if you could not have used that in this case . not even your employee have some duty to these basic office admin work at least a a one warning before sending it back to sender . i do n't get this policy . if the receiver is here , parcel is here , recipient ready to pickup , why they were doing that . now i have to pay again for my parcel to get that . i told them that sender is not in next city , but in another country . that take 16-17 hour to come . but of no use .

The parcel arrived late , so an application for a refund wa made . About 10 day later , a letter wa received denying the claim . The letter said `` we have determined that Canada Post service standard were met and that the item wa delivered a per the guarantee '' . No factual explanation a to why the claim wa denied ; it appeared to be a standard `` bureaucratic '' form letter . When first asking Canada Post about the late delivery , the representative agreed the delivery wa late and issued a Service Ticket number and said a refund cheque should be sent . Following the letter of decline , a second call wa made to ask why the claim could n't be fulfilled with reference to document from Canada Post showing the destination and date ; this information clearly showed the parcel wa delivered late.It wa disappointing to understand why a Service Ticket wa issued in the first place , if Canada Post later said the parcel arrived on schedule . A lot of disappointment and frustration could be avoided here for both party , if the Canada Post service guarantee were actually valid and truthful . Why offer a 6 day delivery guarantee , if it ca n't be honoured ? Date of experience : June 08 , 2017\n",

I did that and then they tell me to wait for a update on my tracking info the following business day that say it will be dropped off at closest office for pick up . I did that and my item wa returned to the original shipper . I havent ordered online before but this ha made my experience with canada post enough to never receive mail from them if i have the shipment option . extremely terrible service and live chat doesnt know anything about their company.Date of experience : June 08 , 2017\n",

I live in an apartment so the notice of attempted delivery is always left on my door or in my mailbox . There wa no notice of delivery left re : this package . When I went to my local Canada Post , they said that they did not receive it there , that it wa at another location - not even in my area . I do n't have a car ( hence , why I ordered online to begin with ) . I called the location where they are holding my package and asked why a attempted delivery notice wa not left at my home and the girl on the phone said , `` Sometimes , they forget to leave a notice . '' So , how would I know my package wa there in the first place if they did n't leave a notice ? I thanked her for her superb customer service ( there wa nothing she could do ) . I hung up and called the Canada Post Support phone line and told the rep my situation . He said that the package would not be re-attempted to be delivered , although they could check if package could be delivered to my local post office ( it could not be ) . He offered to give me the notice of attempted delivery # because without it , I could not go pick up the package . That 's pretty convenient when they `` sometimes forget '' to leave the notice . The customer service from Canada Post wa no help.Date of experience : May 29 , 2017\n",

MAKE CANADA POST BETTER ! I paid extra for tracking and sent two birthday card to my daughter in AB from ONT , both had gift card in them . I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside . These card are extremely meaningful , because her father recently passed away . They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived . If it ha a tracking number , they should be able to locate it , right ? No not yet and there is no one accountable ! What wa the point of paying more ? They need to change their system , perhaps investigate how Purolator , UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery date . It 's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it 's competitor . It 's a sad day when you ca n't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hand of our Canadian Postal Service . The federal gov't need to investigate what is lacking in this service . I 'm guessing not enough employee , outdated technology . I had an MP tell me , sometimes thing get lost but he is sorry for my issue ? I 'm sorry too because that 's an UNACCEPTABLE answer . Obviously after reading all of these review , something is clearly wrong with this service.Date of experience : May 16 , 2023\n",

Closing date is today , seven day later and my lawyer just called to say it did n't arrive . Looked up tracking number , and it 's in mississauga still and if not there the deal may fall through . If it doe , you can bet my lawyer will be in touch . Can get anyone on phone and chat is a useless a their delivery service . Time for Pierre to sell this corporation , like cbc , and use the building for housing.Date of experience : May 29 , 2023\n",

I did that and then they tell me to wait for a update on my tracking info the following business day that say it will be dropped off at closest office for pick up . I did that and my item wa returned to the original shipper .

According to Company wa no duty to be paid ? When questioning Norm Fatima 's staffing bos he explained some parcel picked indiscriminately for this ? ? Not so according to Customs . Package came so damaged in a bag . Laurie at Depot Number 2 told mail person to deliver it a is ? Took two extra week because Laurie and Jill who said they were Superintendents not ! stated it wa locked in cupboard no key or sitting in Vancouver . No-one in depot 2 could give a proper answer . Mr. Wyatt who wa supposed to call could not take the time . Instead Braden another supervisor called and said `` I will tell Laurie and Jill to quit telling people story about their parcel Phone number depot to actually get superintendent 780-944-3402 . Ext.4 Ask for Mr. Wyatt . Customer Service contracted out no help there . And still waiting call from Ombudsman who is supposed to call within 48 hr .

      "4798    Notice of Attempted Delivery NOT leftI wa waiting for my package and decided to check the tracking number when it did not arrive . I live in an apartment so the notice of attempted delivery is always left on my door or in my mailbox . There wa no notice of delivery left re : this package . When I went to my local Canada Post , they said that they did not receive it there , that it wa at another location - not even in my area . I do n't have a car ( hence , why I ordered online to begin with ) . I called the location where they are holding my package and asked why a attempted delivery notice wa not left at my home and the girl on the phone said , `` Sometimes , they forget to leave a notice . '' So , how would I know my package wa there in the first place if they did n't leave a notice ? I thanked her for her superb customer service ( there wa nothing she could do ) . I hung up and called the Canada Post Support phone line and told the rep my situation . He said that the package would not be re-attempted to be delivered , although they could check if package could be delivered to my local post office ( it could not be ) . He offered to give me the notice of attempted delivery # because without it , I could not go pick up the package . That 's pretty convenient when they `` sometimes forget '' to leave the notice . The customer service from Canada Post wa no help.Date of experience : May 29 , 2017\n",

Apparently they can scan the parcel anytime and anywhere after they leave the post office and then mark it a delivered . Canada Post then justified this by saying if you had an envelope purchased from them , they could track to exactly where the deliverer wa when scanning and otherwise they can and do scan in their vehicle before leaving the post office or anywhere in between . I have two witness , the secretary at my office , both stating he did not deliver the package but Canada Post say because he scanned it , it wa delivered . I am being left hanging with their resolution of delivered and no responsibility being taken by the postal service for the loss of my $ 400+ item . Talk about a lousy , expensive and irresponsible service ! ! Date of experience : May 29 , 2017\n",
