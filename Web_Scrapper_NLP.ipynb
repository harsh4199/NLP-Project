Careless handling on the postal carrier is the cause yet nothing is ever done about this and it’s ongoing.The postal carriers don’t really care either!They carry out their shift as fast as possible and that’s it!Their “Service” on all ends is horrible!!!The liability is on Canada Post to locate lost mail/parcels promptly or reimburse individuals in full!!!!Date of experience: July 30, 2023', 'Did the plane crash or are customs holding my item?Posted a small package from England to my sister in Canada on 09:05 28 July 2023.

So why does he even exists if he just repeats what the tracking website says?

I opted in for extra insurance because I didn't want to be on the hook for another missing package.

After speaking to several CP customer service personnel, who had absolutely no interest in helping me find the lost parcel. \"It\\'s lost in the US, not in Canada\" one employee told me.  Another acknowledged it was at a Canada Post office but said there is no way of knowing where.  This has happened a few times lately, with parcels sometimes vanishing without a trace and customer service unblinkingly saying there\\'s no way to know what happened.I am advising my client that the package is lost and not to attempt shipping parcels to Canada through Canada\\'s unreliable postal service.

Canada Post delivers packages that aren't supposed to be safe dropped and others times they don't. Packages that are aloud to be left are sometimes left and others times not. There is no consistency and customer service generally have no idea what they are taking about. I was actually told the reciever isn't important as it's the sender that pays Canada Post. I actually had to to explain to a Canada Post customer service representative that the reciever pays the the sender and if we didn't the sender couldn't pay Canada Post. She actually seemed confused, it felt pretty obvious to me. I'm not completely sure how they are even still in business given all the shipping alternatives. Also in regards to the date of experience, there have been 4 'experiences' in the last 10 days. I had actually had a supervisor call me (the 28th of July), even though he shouldn't have , because the service ticket had been closed the day before. He raised his voice to speak over me and had no concept of customer service. Pretty much everything he said was incorrect in terms of my delivery history. He was adamant that packages won't be safe dropped if they can be seen from the street. I have the tracking numbers of several packages that couldn't fit in the mailbox and in his words wouldn't be delivered, but they were.

The investigation led to Canada post sending me an email asking me if I recieved my package. As of today, I was informed that they can't find my package and a refund would be issued.  The customer service is seriously lacking. Technology is suppose to improve our lives and when a customer pays for tracking it seems unethical that Canada post will not even disclose the location of where the package was recieved (ei. There are many post offices in Mississauga).  Moreover, they did not even explain the process for if the package is recovered eventually. They basically gave my family the run around for the past two months and accept no responsibility for the loss of personal mail. It was exasperating to reach customer service over the phone. Moreover a series of do not reply emails gives CP employees a means by which to avoid accountability. It also denies the consumer the right to ask follow up questions.

There is now a $5 \"fuel surcharge\" on top of their delivery charges. If you\\'re using their site to estimate shipping charges, they neglect to include this fee in their estimate. If you add it, and then compare their charges with those of UPS or Fedex, you\\'ll probably find that while the latter are going to be a couple of dollars more, when you factor in that your recipient will actually get a package - on time -  and not just a \"delivery notice\", they\\'re actually a better deal. A much better deal, in fact. Canada Post used to be able to get away with murder because they were considerably cheaper than the alternatives. Now they charge just as much, only they\\'re days or weeks slower, and don\\'t actually deliver your parcels. Their \"Xpresspost\" service - which they pretend is guaranteed - is neither guaranteed nor express. All you\\'re doing is essentially paying a premium price for regular service - and where Canada Post is concerned, regular service is really, really bad. Just try making a claim when their 1 day guaranteed delivery takes 5 days or longer. Everything, and I mean everything, is excluded from that guarantee.   Be smarter and don\\'t use them. If the company you\\'re shopping with uses them, buy from someone else who uses a better shipper.

No knock, no doorbell, not even footsteps walking up to the door. There was also no sign of any delivery vehicle anywhere in my vicinity all day.

When the lawyer messaged me two business days later, I promised to look at the tracking, and found to my horror that it was in the process of being returned to sender. It wasn't until too late on Thursday March 2 that it showed up as available for pick up at the post office so I went Friday morning March 3. The worker was rude and dismissive, as well as unhelpful. She insisted there was nothing she could do about the fact that it had been correctly addressed and it was not delivered. Apparently I had to go back to the post office where I had sent it to talk to them. To add insult to injury, I had to pay a surcharge for Canada Post's error and incompetence in returning the item, just to receive it, so I could resend it. So I walked over to the UPS Store, and discovered in so doing that the only address visible anywhere online for that lawyer's office was the exact address I had given. There exists no suite number, as the Canada Post worker claimed, so there was no way that it should have been returned. It cost me less for guaranteed next day shipping with UPS and I am much more confident it will actually be delivered.

Wish our old mail delivery person did not retire, their replacement is an incredibly rude and frankly a bit unsuited for mail delivery. Every day she is on her phone the entire route and leaves it on speaker-phone so everyone can hear her conversations that are NOT appropriate to have while working - the topics of some of them probably explain why she marks our adult packages as delivered without delivering them. A nasty piece of work, most definitely. I have debated recording what she says to us when we ask about packages that have been marked as delivered. The issue is if we say anything to her our mail delivery gets even worse. What kind of gestapo/mob tactics does Canada Post employ against people who want their mail? I am not able to inquire about packages that never reach me without her retaliating by delivering our mail to the streets around us (same number, different street) or leaving notes about not being able to deliver for no legitimate reason.

Open a dispute with the company you purchased the item from, explaining it was not delivered? Good luck as the mail delivery person marked it as delivered to our address.

If the Prime Minister doesn't give a damn why should the ones under him, they justify this by thinking if Justin doesn't care why should those making much less care, in the meantime the Canadians are paying good money for a service that doesn't care about them, time to drain the swamp starting with lazy Justin Trudeau and anyone else who use his example.Date of experience: October 03, 2022\", \"1 to 3 day express post and yet I have…1 to 3 day express post and yet I have not received my passport .

I asked why it was delayed, even tho it was already 'out for delivery' and she told me probably due to the events in BC... WHAT? My item was shipped from Calgary with destination in Fort McMurray... all within AB... so where's the logic in that??? I asked if she could at least tell me where my item was located so I could pick it up myself but she couldn't tell me and said it was always moving, possibly from 1 delivery truck to another...

I even arranged for Amazon to stop using them to ship my orders. We pay for them to track parcels and deliver them, but Canada Post refuses to do either. And if your parcel is expensive, they are happy to steal it. People may not realize this, but two years ago they stopped delivering parcels to customers. Now they leave tickets telling us to do their job for them by schlepping to their post offices to pick our parcels up. They even post this policy on their website now, with no explanation why.Recently I ordered a parcel from Europe, that cost over $1000. They shipped it via their country\\'s postal service, which handed it off to the muppets at Canada Post. Had I known that these sticky fingered clowns would have access to my parcel I\\'d have spent the extra $100 to have it shipped with a real courier. In the past Canada Post operatives have stolen two high value parcels from me. Anything over $200 value is fair game for these thieves. They stop scanning a parcel so it can\\'t be traced, and then it teleports into the back of some CP employee\\'s car. Then they lie to the customer that it\\'s \"on its way\".The clowns stopped scanning my shipment as soon as it cleared customs in BC. I guess there must have been a customs sticker on the box with the value. Normally a Canada Post shipment from BC to Ontario takes 4 days max. It\\'s now been nearly a week and the parcel hasn\\'t been scanned at all. Another mysterious teleporting situation...I opened a chat session with Canada Post\\'s \"customer service\". All they did was repeat the same non-existent tracking info over and over again, lied and lied that it was coming today, refused to offer to trace the shipment and then became rude and sarcastic when I asked about filing a claim for the value. They told me to set up email alerts for the shipment, except I did that a week ago and haven\\'t received anything. Then when I complained about the parcel being lost because they refused to do their job and scan it, and told them I\\'d be filing a claim and they\\'d lose almost $1100, \"awesome!\" was their \"customer service\" exact reply. So they think it\\'s a big joke when they lose or steal a $1000 shipment. The real joke is Canada Post and the fact that their tax paying customers have to subsidize their arrogance, incompetence, thievery and laziness.

The chairs are made of resin they are very light and easy to move. Canada Post is a lazy government run body and something needs to change.

So I have had a few challenges recently with Canada Post delivering my parcels to our community mailbox and putting the keys to open the parcel compartment in my neighbour’s mailbox. Today two parcels were supposed to have been delivered, but no key for me to open compartment. I filed a ticket on-line (a bit frustrating but I did). I then got a follow up call from John Goodger with CP. he was truly awesome. On a Friday night at 9:20 pm he came to our community mailbox and opened it up to check the compartments. Luckily my packages were there. I was so impressed that he would actually drive to our mailbox, meet me there, in an effort to solve the problem. Mistakes happen but this customer service was exemplary.Date of experience: August 14, 2021', 'Stay tuned for updates means were not doing anything until you tell us to\"Item delayed — stay tuned for updates\" sounds like Canada Post is doing something and you should wait to receive updates.

Can you learn from them please.Date of experience: August 13, 2021', 'Constantly leaves packages in unsecure locationsCanada Post\\'s so-called Knock, Drop, and Go policy (\"Safe Drop\") is very unprofessional and lazy, incredibly unempathetic and inconsiderate for both the sender and receiver, and their property, through incompetence, maliciousness, and negligence, especially for persons who are tenants of apartment buildings. Packages, even high value items, are being left in hallway spaces (common areas), with free access to anyone in the building, and are highly subject to theft, especially for suites located in high-traffic zones such as those near main entrances, parking areas, stairways, and elevators. They don\\'t bother to verify if there is anyone even home and available to pick up packages before abandoning them; this is not a \"delivery\", it is abandonment and negligence. This policy victimizes customers and seemingly sacrifices the security, privacy, and integrity of mail, while claiming to favour so-called \"social distancing\".Unfortunately this has been a recurring problem for a decade, so COVID-19 is no excuse. Creating service tickets only temporarily helps (and ONLY if/when depot supervisors/superintendents actually care about the nature of these complaints), because the actual delivery agents themselves too often could not care less, their turnover rate so high and training so poor that the problem simply repeats with new employees.FlexDelivery and parcel lockers are fair suggestions, but are ultimately used as excuses for negligence.If items are unable to be placed in secure mail boxes in apartment buildings, Canada Post MUST leave a delivery notice card and forward such items to the local post office for pick up. If necessary, Canada Post should create a system and database for scheduled pick up. I have reported this type of malpractice several times now. It is unconscionable that Canada Post is victimizing people by sacrificing the security, privacy, and integrity of mail. This is absolutely unacceptable and I demand that this be resolved immediately.Here are just a few reasons Canada Post should be FULLY privatized to give consumers actual choice in a free market over the current monopoly:• letter carrier transportation sub-contracted through private taxi cabs companies• parcel delivery sub-contracted• mail box pickup sub-contracted with U-Haul trucks• customer service sub-contracted through private call centres, non-CUPW employees• post offices managed as private franchises• FedEx and DHL handle and deliver certain packages coming from the USA on behalf of Canada Post• Purolator handles and delivers certain packages on behalf of Canada Post, and Canada Post (i.e. the taxpayer) holds shares in a formerly private company• Amazon has set up their own successful delivery service to bypass Canada Post because of the frequent strikes and unreliability of the service• 2 major strikes in 5 years (2016, 2018); greed, selfishness• strikes throw public under the bus; strategically and tactically using public as pawns during onset of Christmas holiday seasons for maximum leverage, negotiation, bargaining for their personal gain• simple job not requiring any post secondary education, 10yo can deliver papers and do many similar jobs at Canada Post• if CUPW employees don\\'t want to work they should quit, hire people who want to work, hire paperboys/papergirls• other countries and marketplace sellers/platforms (Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, etc.) are blacklisting Canada to protect themselves from claims, lost/stolen/undelivered packages, and refundsDate of experience: August 12, 2021', 'I have a package that was supposed to…I have a package that was supposed to arrive two days ago but when I check the tracking it appears to have been sitting in the Richmond sorting centre for three days and is now expected to arrive tomorrow.

Now I have to re-order the product and ship it to my home address. Why Canada Post cannot stop a package from being returned to the sender if the purchaser contacts them is beyond me.

This “Canadian Corporation” is not worthy of it’s name. It’s association with Loblaws/Shoppers Drug Mart is not conducive to serving the Canadian public. At best it serves Loblaws.In my experience, they never deliver a parcel to one’s door. They drop a card and the onus is on the customer to get to a Shoppers location of their assign, convenient or not, to pick up their parcel within 15 calendar days. For me, it happens to be on DuPont Street in Toronto, a location with no parking, on a busy street, a good 30 minutes’ walk from my house and I have to walk it since there is no parking! And I have to walk back, with a heavy parcel in tow! This is impossible for me.There could be better locations, some with parking, but choosing another location for myself is not an option. I once had my car towed in the three minutes that I ran into that location to get a parcel. It cost me $250.  But that is the least of their concerns. Not only is the service poor and incompetent but their utter lack of concern for their clients is shameful and quite beyond fixing.I have complained dozens of times to Canada Post about these damned Shoppers’ Drug Mart locations. I used to drive for miles to use one of the few still privately owned locations and then they eliminated them. 99% of the reviews posted here are strongly negative. One can easily sense the deep frustrations of all who troubled themselves to review this service, OUR NATIONAL POSTAL SERVICE!!! but who is reading. Certainly not Canada Post.If I were Justin Trudeau and company, I would dismantle this outfit tomorrow and install a Canadian Postal service of international standard that we can be proud of.  National postal services should be a matter of national pride. Its quality should reflect the image we want to project to the outside world. It is worth paying for. What we have, masquerading as “Canada Post” is nothing to be proud of. Is it any wonder that their sloppiness has caused the proliferation of a multitude of private delivery services in our country, all of which provide safer and more ethical services to Canadians than our own National Postal Service.

Normally it\\'s things like my package is a month late or something like that but recently I have had even more frustrating experiences just trying to prove I am who I am.After ordering a package that would be too large to fit in my mailbox or leave at my door (not sure why it\\'s to large to leave at my door but it is what it is) they sent me a notification that they left a notification delivery card. However after checking both my front door and my mailbox there was no card. So I attempt to go to the post office anyways to get my package thinking I should be fine since I can prove who I am with my drivers license. However when I get there the person at the desk would not take my card because it is expired. Due to covid I have not gotten my cards renewed yet because I\\'ve only just received my second dose and did not want to risk anything yet. I figured this wouldn\\'t be a problem since the government of Canada has held off invalidating expired cards that expired after a certain date (which my card has). I even checked the validity of my card online and it assures me that it is still a valid card. Fortunately they say I can get my passport to prove my identity, so I do that. But now they require a proof of address because I don\\'t have the notification of delivery card that they failed to deliver. This is fine because I have bank documents proving my location on my phone ( I use simplii so all my documents and banking is done online ). However the worker at the desk refuses to look at my phone, stating that \"we don\\'t look at phones\". Fortunately I also have a TD self-directed investing account so go to the nearest TD and get them to first change the address on my account ( my address doesn\\'t match the delivery address because I am currently living with my parents since work is remote right now and I enjoy the company ) then get them to print a document for me to show this address. WOW PROVES THAT I LIVE AT THAT ADDRESS SO MUCH RIGHT? Something that definitely could not have been done through documents shown or printed from my phone. Finally I go back to the post office and they let me take my package. But not before giving the box a cheeky little tap on the circled sticker on it that is supposed to indicate that a notice of delivery has been delivered and telling me \"oh if you brought the notice of delivery you wouldn\\'t have to get the bank document\".

I\\'m upping my rating of Canada Post, properly and fairly,  because I\\'m sure it was, except for a very brief time, solely the USPS that handled my parcel after it landed in The Windy City. Still, Canada Post could be a little faster in handling, even though they\\'re exonerated from blame for losing my package. ; ] Well, let me start by saying that with 95% of the more than 4,100 reviews here being \\'Bad\\', it would appear that Canada Post doesn\\'t care nearly enough about their service quality or public image. The company\\'s performance can\\'t be this broadly deplorable by mere luck of the draw.I\\'m seeing reviews that are merely a day or a week old, and they\\'re ALL negative. I had intended to wait until my package arrived before leaving a review, if I\\'d even decided to leave one. I changed my mind when I saw that my invisible traveler went from one to then two days past its expected delivery date, and further yet. The given delivery timeline was already almost \\'unacceptable\\', noting the distance between points A and B, as the saying goes. This alert of even longer and indeterminable transit time was issued after many days of my parcel floating around with no tracking updates at all following its arrival in Chicago five days after being mailed. It has no projected time for reappearing on the radar, and I\\'m told in resignation to simply \"stay tuned for updates\". Isn\\'t that the sole purpose of \\'tracking\\'?I live in New York State, near Albany. I HAVE had a couple of items over the last few years ship from Canada via Canada Post with no issues that come to mind as you would expect glaring mistakes and ineptness to do. My parcel has been handed over to the USPS, which lost a lot of credibility and respect this past Christmas season. At this point I don\\'t know how much direct involvement Canada Post has. That said, the USPS tracking history only shows what Canada Post\\'s site does -- an arrival in Chicago on May 2nd -- two weeks ago. My package was shipped by an Etsy vendor on April 27th. This seller is in Teeswater, Ontario. I \\'Googled it\\', and a literal drive to pick up my order would have taken 473 miles and about nine hours one-way. The laughable COVID restrictions that we\\'re under have been given and continue to get a lot of easy blame for postal delays, as well as for other disruptions of \\'normal\\' living conditions.In a funny twist, a Wikipedia page reveals early in its profile of the town of Teeswater, from where my item shipped, that the Post Office there dates from 1855. Maybe Canada Post is stuck in the days of America\\'s Pony Express. ; ] I\\'m sure that these delays are arguably \\'First-World problems\\' in most cases, but they are still unacceptable by 2021 standards of living. They\\'re greatly affecting commerce and customer satisfaction, and they shouldn\\'t exist more than a year into this \\'pandemic\\' morass. These people, as well as all other delivery companies, have had enough time to get their proverbial poop in a group in response to most if not all COVID upheavals. As I think I read in another astute review, Canada Post\\'s ONLY job, in the final analysis, is to get packages from a point of origin to a destination. COVID can\\'t be ascribed that much blame for Canada Post\\'s inconceivable number of unexplained failures between acceptance and wildly delayed final delivery of items. An actual current location of my package would be enough to satisfy me at this point, even if it\\'s just languishing at a hub, especially in light of how many complaints I\\'ve read about packages going from being delayed to missing altogether -- some with \\'delivery confirmation\\'. : / In fairness, I don\\'t work in that thankless industry, so I don\\'t know what a day in the trenches is like. Also, to reiterate, The USPS majorly stubbed its toe this past Christmas season, but I think they\\'ve regained balance.

Furthermore, if my package has been damaged by your irresponsible staff whom throw packages around and i paid insurance on that package, then why would you not honor that insurance and why is it only valued at $120 meanwhile the value of my package maybe higher. So in other courier companies when you pay insurance they ask you the value of your item and based on that if your item is damaged by them they pay you the value of your package. Meanwhile all the professionals in Canada Post, will blame you for using their service claiming and i quote \"Every Person is entitled to send mail through Canada Post\", supposedly and if my package does not comply with your shipping policy why do you still accept it and then damage my product, causing me a complete loss and then finally you do not honor my insurance claim??

How can you claim professionalism when you keep having delivery issues every year in Christmas?

The exchange is on video surveillance from inside the store location, which is a stand alone retail store, not part of any convenience or other store.After contacting Canada Post and filing a detailed complaint, I received a voicemail from the area manager, Sam, who had no idea what the situation was.  He left me a voicemail with no way to reach him, and just the general number in order to track the package, which was already in the hanss of Amazon by this time.After contacting Canada Post again multiple times via email to issue a complaint, each time the response from the organization was dismissive or made promises for someone to call me but they never did.  When I finally spoke with the area manager, I did not know the voicemail that had been left for me before was the same person, as I had spoken to many people along the way.Since he didn’t leave any specific contact information in the voicemail so that I could speak with him again, I didn’t think much of it when we finally spoke when I called and worked my way to a depot to find out where my complaint was at, and I hadn’t connected the voicemail to him until shortly after our call, and I discovered that luckily I had saved the actual voicemail still.In the 30 second voicemail, there is no mention about the fact the employee did this, other than to say that he would speak with the employee.Canada Post has a Code of Conduct which protects employees from harassment and disrespect and it also speaks to the respect it’s employees are to show to customers.Not satisfied with the area manager’s response, as when we spoke he still was unaware of many of the actual details of the problem until I told him on the phone, even though great detail was provided to customer service in my original complaint call to the organization, I finally decided to contact the Ombudsman.The area manager told me that the employee had a spotless record, and that when he spoke with the employee about the incident (albeit ill informed since he wasn’t aware of many of the details until we were on this very call), and the employee denied any recollection of this event, so I wanted to make sure this was dealt with adequately - this employee should not be handling the details counter if he is unable to conduct himself according to the Code of Conduct.I sent the information to the Ombudsman, and without the Ombudsman calling to speak with me or to clarify any of the information, sent me a letter stating that their investigation was closed and that no further action was going to be taken.Shocked since they hadn’t even spoke to me to discuss this matter first, I read the letter again and discovered that the location that the Ombudsman cites as having been investigated, and which the Ombudsman said there was no longer any security footage available to verify my story, was a Shoppers Drug Mart Postal outlet — not the location the incident happened at and which had nothing to do with the situation.  The location and security footage information that the Ombudsman cites in their response letter to my Appeal speaks to footage for a Canada Post location in an entirely different building, on a different street and that has its own video surveillance policies and footage per Loblaws that owns Shoppers Drug Mart.  The incident I had did not happen in, or anywhere near, the loacation the Ombudman investigated.  No wonder the file was closed - except why not contact me first before closing the file?All around this has been a colossal failure of policies and service, and it is right for me to expect better both in terms of the service that I received and with respect to the follow up and investigation that was done after the fact.

The pandemic should not be used as an excuse to delay an essential service. Other industries have adapted to the consumers needs.

They are part of the commonwealth as well as Canada).  The package contains a pair of warm wool socks, but since it took 97 days to arrive, my feet were freezing for the last 3 months. The same package posted on the same day arrived in Australia 2 months ago (Yes Aussies get cold feet too) and 3 weeks ago in the USA (Don’t praise Donald for this, he’s GONE.)  I understand the concept of running a business efficiently in order to provide dividends for your sole shareholder (Government of Canada), even if it’s to the detriment of your customers.   I was wondering how long it takes for a transatlantic cross over and I believe that I found who may have been your mail carrier: A 72-year-old UK man has completed a solo trans-Atlantic rowing trip in 96 days.I just hope that as every other Canada Post employees, this 72 years old man is unionized and get full benefits. He deserve it!I believe that Canada Post should be replaced by Amazon and they should get all the federal subsidies that Canada post is receiving now. With Amazon Prime ($9.00 a month), it takes a couple of days for an unlimited amount of packages to arrive to Canada from Europe. (Amazon may be able to afford way bigger oars for their row boats)At least, Canada Post CEO should sign for one of the training seminars organized by Mr. Bezos (Amazon CEO).  If it’s your intention to stay in business for the foreseeable future this may help you to sort your total inefficiency. I will even not talk about shipping coast which is 2 to 3 times higher in Canada than other countries (It must take a postman with a bachelor degree to open a community mail box). Hope you get at least a smile from this letter, but sadly Canada Post doesn’t get any satisfaction from their customers.

I didn't want to pay $75 for trackable shipping so I paid $35 and was told 3 weeks for delivery. It's February and the package still has not been received and likely wont be now. Last November an order coming from China made it into the hands of Canada Post in just 5 DAYS, only to sit with Canada Post for 6 weeks before arriving late for Xmas. I've recently had a package sent from GB with tracking included. It's been in Canada Post's hands now for over a week and they tell me it's not trackable and can't tell me where it is. Calling Canada Post was a complete waste of time starting with the almost 10 minutes it took to actually get to speak with a person, enduring option after option designed to deter people from getting through to a human, and then having them give me an excuse pointing a finger in every direction away from themselves, actually telling me to contact Royal Mail in GB to try to find out where in Canada (with Canada Post) my package is. Unbelievably horrendous service and customer care. I felt insulted by the stupidity of the rehearsed excuses being given. Covid or not, Canada post is incapable of providing the service paid for by it's customers. The main excuse being they handle billions of packages regularly. If CP can't handle the work load then they need to step up the process by hiring more manpower etc. Canada Post rates are not cheap. If they are handling billions then they are making billions. The disrespect shown to customers is absolutely disgraceful. Shame on you Canada Post.

The vendor advises that they don't know how it will be shipped until it is ready to be shipped. For ie, a vendor I use frequently usually sends by mail but recently sent by courier and it was returned to sender because a courier cannot deliver to a box number. If I use my physical address thinking it will be a courier delivery and instead it's mailed, the post office will not deliver to my physical address. At times I have put both addresses down and I get a nasty note from Canada Post that they will return my parcel to sender if I do that again.

When I insisted to speak to the supervisor, she told me that it was last scanned in Ottawa on the 30th. So why can't I see that on the tracking website?

Tried to be sent to a manger the guy  says okay a manager will be with you within 30 seconds ....Well 40 mins later still on hold..gave up. I finally called the post office that my son mailed it from and talked to the lady that actually remembers my son and she tells me it might have gone to a facility that got covid and then it would be there possibly for months...omg seriously. Finally I was able to speak with a very nice lady who is actually trying to help me... When i asked her about the whole covid facility excuse she said that she had never even heard of such a thing... proving what i already knew that they will blame covid for them not doing their jobs. I don't usually use Canada Post but i figured since with all the small businesses in Canada shutting down due to covid and courier services are mostly american owned i thought I'd support Canada.... So considering they had to know that they were going to way busier then any other Christmas seasons and knew so for a long time there is absolutely no excuse as to why they didn't have more people working to make sure everything was done properly and efficiently ... thoroughly disgusted by the way the Canada Postal Service and it's  employees don't give a tossDate of experience: December 30, 2020\", 'very bad servicesI have a packahe that came to canada in Nov 25 (processing center), but today is Dec 29, no update, no delivery.There is no easy way to contact canada post to ask abot my package.

Don't sell a guaranteed service for double postage that you can't come anywhere near making the timeline for. Covid is used as an excuse for everything. I have filed a refund request and suggest everyone else do the same. Everyone can find the link by searching for Canada Post Refund. When it asks for a Business Name where you have to input something just put your first and last name. They'll probably say nothing is guaranteed right now but then they should NOT sell a service that they call guaranteed (like Xpresspost) and charge more than just standard delivery. They even list delivery cut off dates online that show Dec 17-18 as cutoff for delivery for Xpresspost... thats obviously not what they could make. We all need to make a fuss and not let them get away with it! I expect at minimum a refund between the cost of xpresspost and standard mail. May even go to media with complaint if they won't willingly refund as they have obviously done this to a lot of people.

In August an Expediated Parcel marked \"leave at the Door\" was taken to a Postal Outlet 2 blocks north of the Post Office. We were notified by email. Why not Knock, Drop and Go?

Since March 13 we have been self-isolating under doctor\\'s orders.  In desperation we applied for Accommodation delivery  in September.   CP has agreed to deliver our mail once a week if we put a mailbox 700 m from the road, but the delivery agent refuses to take the mail up a short grade to our door, for her Health and Safety.  She doesn\\'t care if one of us with mobility issues, ( the reason we are eligible for Accommodation in the first place) falls while we go up and down the grade to the mailbox.

I realize that I am very lucky to be able to buy directly from the artist and may be able to pay the artist better and make a few dollars myself. I discuss what my intentions were going to be with artist and tell him I am going to put it on kijji and see if they sell. First one is a 30 pound 14 inch 4 way dancing bear, it’s on kijiji a couple days and a couple from Edmonton buy it for over 2000$ and the second one I put on was bigger at 18 inches and over 50 pounds it sold a couple days after and was destined to Montreal. I have never used Canada post for any such transactions or to mail a valuable item until the one week. The first bear I boxed well and took pictures for the receiver to show I was shipping it and the post office told me about the insurance so I figured I wouldn’t need it and should be no problem but I put 1000$ on this carving, which would be appraised at about 3-3500$. The second bigger one I take and ship it 4 days after the first one and I put only 2000$ on this carving that was sold for 5200$ and figure it should be fine and thought I had found a pretty good way to make a few extra dollars and help the artist. So a day or two goes by and the couple in Edmonton contact me and send pictures before they even open the box and it’s damaged, start the insurance claim and do all they ask and they deny it for reasons they can’t back up I was told by Canada post there was no appeal process but there is and I appealed and stated reasons why I should receive my claim. The ombudsman does more investigation and comes up with I can’t show proper receipt of what I paid for it but they give me 200$ after a month and a half. The second one it makes all the scans to Montreal and then scanned out for delivery and does not make it. I call they tell me not to worry it’s busy but they are sure it will get there.

Careless handling on the postal carrier is the cause yet nothing is ever done about this and it’s ongoing.The postal carriers don’t really care either!They carry out their shift as fast as possible and that’s it!Their “Service” on all ends is horrible!!!The liability is on Canada Post to locate lost mail/parcels promptly or reimburse individuals in full!!!!Date of experience: July 30, 2023'"
